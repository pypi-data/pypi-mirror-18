This Package implement linked list using python.
I tried to implement this structure as convinent as possible.

in the Implementation.py file you will see the imlement of the node , and the implement of the list.
additionally in the Algorithems.py  you will find four algorithems that will ease your work with linked list such as:sorting the list, reverse the list, an algorithem that checks if there is a loop in the linked list and where it begins, and an algorithem that checks if two linked list intersect in some point.

I added an HowToUse files, that show exaclly how to use each part of the implemntation.

Good Luck!
