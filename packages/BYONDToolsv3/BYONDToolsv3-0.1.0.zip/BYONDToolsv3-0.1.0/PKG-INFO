Description: ==========
        BYONDTools
        ==========
        
        A set of tools for BYOND-based games.
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This is a toolkit for developers of BYOND-based games intended to do common, complex
        tasks that the engine itself does not currently possess.  It also exposes common
        interfaces for developers wishing to obtain information from the BYOND object tree,
        maps, and DMIs.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Python 3 
        * Pillow (fork of PIL)
        * numpy
        
        Use

        =================
        
        * Split get-dmi-data into two utilities - old header extraction is now under get-dmi-header, and get-dmi-data now produces a generated header.
        
        =================
        0.0.1 - 18/11/2016
        =================
        
        * Started new fork of ByondTools with breaking changes planned.
        * Changed DMI's get-dmi-data to write to stdout.
        * Updated code to compile under Python 3 - functionality not tested.
        
        =================
        0.1.7 - 3/6/2015
        =================
        
        * Added pyparsing-based list() parser to DMM system
        * DMMFix lives again!
        * Move from print() to logging for console logging.
        * Renamed ss13_makeinhands to dmi_compile, now uses a dmi_config.yml file.
        * Fixed dmindent duplicating proc contents, cleaned out excessive newlines.
        
        =================
        0.1.6 - 12/24/2014
        =================
        
        * Fixed completely broken map rendering system.
        * Repaired object tree generation
        * Fixed color support
        
        =================
        0.1.5 - 6/18/2014
        =================
        
        * Emergency path fix for Linux
        
        =================
        0.1.4 - 6/18/2014
        =================
        
        * Added dmm diff and patch commands for patching maps.
        * Added color name support to BYOND2RGBA.  Should fix rendering maps on TG/NT/Bay.
        * Proper handling of nulls.
        
        =================
        0.1.3 - 6/17/2014
        =================
        
        * Fixed broken post-install operation on Linux (sorry)
        
        =================
        0.1.2 - 6/17/2014
        =================
        
        * Fixed line-ending stupidity on Linux
        * Fixed python trying to interpret DME-derived paths literally (mostly path seperator stuff)
        
        =================
        0.1.1c - 6/10/2014
        =================
        
        * Missed data directory.  Whoops.
        * Object tree: Fixed mishandling of list() in variables when [ is on the same line.
        
        =================
        0.1.1b - 6/2/2014
        =================
        
        * Fixed some leftover packaging issues:
        
          * post-install didn't create self-executables on Linux, so just calling dmi, dmmfix, etc. wouldn't work.
          * setup.py didn't specify sub-packages for installation, so installations were fairly broken.
         
        * Post-install process now uses sys.executable, rather than trying to figure it out via hackier means.
        * README changed to reStructuredText for eventual pip release.
        * Oh my god there's a changelog now
        * Added MANIFEST.in (fixed a problem uploading *.rst files).
