Description: 
            The Head First Python Database Context Manager.
        
            Devised, coded, and built during Chapters 7, 8, and 9 of the 2nd edition
            of Head First Python (by O'Reilly Media).  Used and extended with support
            for custom exceptions in Chapter 11.
        
            Released into the wild at the suggestion of one of Paul's ex-students (thanks @csl_).
        
            If you really need to do stuff like this, use SQLAlchemy (and/or Dataset) instead.
        
            Python 3 only (due to type hints and new syntax).  Should be easy enough to backport
            if you need to.  Also: from v1.7.x this code takes advantage of raise's "from" syntax.
