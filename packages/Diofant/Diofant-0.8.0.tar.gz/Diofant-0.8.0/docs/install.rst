Installation
------------

The Diofant can be installed on virtually any computer with Python 3.4
or above.  Diofant requires `setuptools`_.  You can install latest
release with pip::

    $ pip install diofant

or to install also extra dependencies::

    $ pip install diofant[gmpy,plot]

.. tip::

    You could use `pyvenv`_ to create isolated Python environment
    first, instead of installing everything system-wide.

.. _installation-src:

From Sources
============

If you are a developer or like to get the latest updates as they come,
be sure to install from git::

    $ git clone git://github.com/diofant/diofant.git
    $ cd diofant
    $ pip install -e .[develop,docs]

Run Diofant
===========

To verify that your freshly-installed Diofant works, please start up
the Python interpreter and execute some simple statements like the
ones below::

    >>> from diofant.abc import x
    >>> ((1 + x)**(1/x)).limit(x, 0)
    E

However, we recommend using `IPython`_ for working interactively.  Use
input transformations from the module :mod:`diofant.interactive`, that
could reduce boilerplate while interacting with Diofant due to the
Python language syntax.

For a starter guide on using Diofant, refer to the :ref:`tutorial`.
