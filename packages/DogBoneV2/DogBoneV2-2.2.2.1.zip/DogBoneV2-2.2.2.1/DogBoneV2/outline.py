Outline is a subclass of LineGroup with extra methods for checking if it
is a closed polygon. The Outline can be manifold (have internal holes) as long
as they are fully enclosed inside of the boundary.

        This method determines if the point is inside

        If a line is drawn from the point to outside of the outline the number

        The default ray is at an angle of about 3.6 degrees. A little testing
        showed this angle to be fairly unlikely to cause endpoint collisions.
        When a collision does occur we draw the new ray at the current angle plus
        90 degrees plus a random value between [0-1). The 90 degrees is to make
        the new ray perpendicular to the current one and hopefully less likely
