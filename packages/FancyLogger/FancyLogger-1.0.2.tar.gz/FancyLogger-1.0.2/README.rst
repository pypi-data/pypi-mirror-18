# FancyLogger
Fork of 'aubricus/print_progress.py' originated from StackOverflow's Greenstick to allow using multiple progress bars along with regular message logger.

 * Support for multiple progress bars
 * Auto-scrolling message logger below the progress bars
 * Configurable decimals for percentage
 * Display elapsed time in human readable format from seconds to weeks
 * Display a prefix to the left of the progress bar
 * Display a suffix to the right of the progress bar
 * Keep alive even when completed
 * Displayed length of the progress bar can vary
 * Multiple progress bars will stay left-aligned
 * Keep space for permanent progress bar slots
 * Define the maximum number of displayed messages, but log files will keep them all
 * Python's multiprocessing support
