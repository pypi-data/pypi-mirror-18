        This Python Package provides a probabilistic model to classify nucleotide
        sequences in metagenome samples. It was developed as a framework to help
        researchers to reconstruct individual genomes from such datasets using custom
        workflows and to give developers the possibility to integrate the model into
        their programs.

        Features
        --------
        
        * Integrates nucleotide composition, multi-sample coverage
          and taxonomic annotation
        * Learns a model in linear time with respect to the number of input sequences
        * Classifies novel sequences in linear time
        * Calculates likelihood and p-values
        * Calculates probabilistic distances between genome bins
