Description: Synopsis
        --------
        
        Mimir is a simple, command line based note taking application. Designed
        with git syntax and usage in mind, its aim is to provide quick, concise
        notes, that can be easily included in the project/directory where they
        are created.
        
        Code Example
        ------------
        
        Mimir can be initialized within any directory. Each mimir instance keep
        track of its own notes.
        
        Initialize mimir within a directory:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mimir init
        
        This will create a new directory, .mimir, and a config file,
        .mimir/.mimir-config
        
        Delete mimir from a directory:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mimir delete
        
        This deletes the mimir present in the working directory. It will also
        delete any config files and all notes.
        
        To create a new note, simply:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mimir This is my brand new note!
        
        Or, to add a new note with tags:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mimir This is a note with a @tag
        
        The note will be added to ``.mimir/mimir_notes.txt``
        
        To show notes:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mimir -s 1
            mimir -s 2
        
        Will show the last one and two notes, respectively.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mimir @tag1
            mimir @tag1 @tag2
        
        If only tags are provided to mimir, it will assume you want to search by
        tags, rather than create a new note
        
        Notes can also be searched via date fences:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mimir --since 2010 --until october
            mimir --since june
            mimir --until 2015
        
        Date fences can be mixed with tags and the -s option for more fine
        grained searching.
        
        To edit notes:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mimir edit
        
        This will open the mimir notes file in your specified editor (this must
        be set in .mimir-config)
        
        Finally, you can also view the status of your mimir, view a count of all
        tags present, or delete it entirely:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mimir status
            mimir tags
            mimir delete
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install via pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install mimirnotes
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        Mimir uses Pytest for testing.
        
        From the root project directory, simply run ``pytest``
