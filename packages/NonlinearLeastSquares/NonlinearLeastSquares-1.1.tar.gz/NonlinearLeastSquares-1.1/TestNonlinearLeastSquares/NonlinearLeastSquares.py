CHANGE LOG:

  Version 1.1:

    This version fixes a bug in the synthetic data generator function used
    for illustrating the functionality of the NonlinearLeastSquares class.
    Changes also made to the information that is printed out when the
    module is run in the debug mode.

  Version 1.0:

    In the form of a class named NonlinearLeastSquares, this module
    provides a domain agnostic implementation of nonlinear least-squares
    algorithms (gradient-descent and Levenberg-Marquardt) for fitting a
    model to observed data.  Typically, the model involves several
    parameters and each observed data element can be expressed as a
    function of those parameters plus noise.  The goal of nonlinear
    least-squares is to estimate the best values for the parameters given
    all of the observed data.  In order to illustrate how to use the
    NonlinearLeastSquares class, the module also comes with another class,
    OptimizeSurfaceFit, whose job is to fit the best surface (of a
    specified analytical form) to noisy height data over the XY-plane. The
    model in this case is the analytical description of the surface and the
    goal of nonlinear least-squares is to estimate the best values for the
    parameters in the model.


@title
USAGE:

    You need to create an instance of the NonlinearLeastSquares class as
    shown in line (A) below.  In addition, you need to create an instance
    of your own domain-specific class whose responsibilities are explained
    in the Introduction section of this document.  For example, for finding
    the parameters of a model that you wish to fit to noisy height data
    over the xy-plane, for the domain specific class you would create an
    instance of the OptimizeSurfaceFit class as shown in line (B) below.
    Note that in the example shown in line (B), the domain-specific class
    has two duties: (1) to synthetically generate noisy measurement data;
    and (2) to call on NonlinearLeastSquares to fit an optimized model to
    the synthetically generated data.

        optimizer =  NonlinearLeastSquares(                              #(A)
                         max_iterations = 400,
                         delta_for_jacobian = 0.000001,
                         delta_for_step_size = 0.0001,
                     )

        surface_fitter = OptimizeSurfaceFit(                             #(B)                
                                gen_data_synthetically = True,
                                datagen_functional = "7.8*(x - 0.5)**3 + 2.2*(y - 0.5)**2",
                                data_array_size = (16,16),
                                how_much_noise_for_synthetic_data = 0.7,
                                model_functional = "a*(x-b)**3 + c*(y-d)**2",
                                initial_param_values = {'a':2.0, 'b':0.4, 'c':0.8, 'd':0.4},
                                display_needed = True,
                                debug = True,
                         )

        surface_fitter.set_constructor_options_for_optimizer(optimizer)  #(C)

        result = surface_fitter.calculate_best_fitting_surface('lm')     #(D)

        or 

        result = surface_fitter.calculate_best_fitting_surface('gd')     #(E)

    In line (C), it is the job of the OptimizeSurfaceFit instance as
    constructed in line (B) to export the domain-related information (after
    it is packaged under the hood into a domain-agnostic form) to the
    instance of NonlinearLeastSquares that was constructed in line (A).
    The information that the OptimizeSurfaceFit instance conveys to the
    NonlinearLeastSquares instance includes:

        1) The observed data vector.  This vector is denoted X in the
           NonlinearLeastSquares class.  The same notation is used
           for the observed data vector in the usage-example class
           OptimizeSurfaceFit.

        2) The initial values to be used for the parameters of the model.

        3) A vector of the predicted values for each of the data elements
           in X, all in functional form involving the parameters of the
           model.  This vector is denoted Fvec in the NonlinearLeastSquares
           class.

        4) The display function to be used for plotting the partial and the
           final results if at all such results can be displayed in the
           form of a 2D or 3D graphic with Python's matplotlib library.

    Finally, the statement in line (D) lets you call on the
    Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for estimating the model parameters. If
    you would rather use the more basic gradient-descent algorithm for that
    purpose, your call will look like what is shown in line (E).

    In solving these types of problems, sometimes it is possible to
    explicitly declare the Jacobian matrix that is used by nonlinear
    least-squares algorithms.  This matrix is of size Nxp where N is the
    total number of observations in the data vector X and p the number of
    parameters in the model. The (i,j)-th element of the Jacobian matrix is
    the partial derivative of the i-th element of the predictor vector Fvec
    with respect to the j-th model parameter.  If you wish to supply this
    matrix explicitly to NonlinearLeastSquares (as opposed to letting
    NonlinearLeastSquares estimate it numerically), you must use your
    domain knowledge to first construct the Jacobian matrix in your own
    domain-specific class and then convey it to an instance of
    NonlinearLeastSquares through the constructor option
    'jacobian_functionals_array' of the latter.  [See the definition of the
    method set_jacobian_functionals_array() of the NonlinearLeastSquares
    class.]  For our example domain-specific class OptimizeSurfaceFit, such
    a matrix can be constructed from the partial derivatives of the model
    functional.  In the following example, a user supplies these partial
    derivatives to an instance of OptimizeSurfaceFit through its
    constructor option 'partials_for_jacobian':

        optimizer =  NonlinearLeastSquares(                              #(A)
                         max_iterations = 400,
                         delta_for_jacobian = 0.000001,
                         delta_for_step_size = 0.0001,
                     )

        surface_fitter = OptimizeSurfaceFit(                             #(B)             
                                gen_data_synthetically = True,
                                datagen_functional = "7.8*(x - 0.5)**3 + 2.2*(y - 0.5)**2",
                                data_array_size = (16,16),
                                how_much_noise_for_synthetic_data = 0.7,
                                model_functional = "a*(x-b)**3 + c*(y-d)**2",
                                initial_param_values = initial_param_values,
                                partials_for_jacobian = {'a':'(x-b)**3',
                                                         'b':'-3*a*(x-b)**2',
                                                         'c':'(y-d)**2',
                                                         'd':'-2*c*(y-d)'},
                                display_needed = True,
                                debug = True,
                         )

        surface_fitter.set_constructor_options_for_optimizer(optimizer)  #(C)

        result = surface_fitter.calculate_best_fitting_surface('lm')     #(D)

        or 

        result = surface_fitter.calculate_best_fitting_surface('gd')     #(E)

    In this case, the call to the "set_constructor_options_for_optimizer()"
    method of the OptimizeSurfaceFit class that is shown above also exports
    the partial derivatives needed by the Jacobian to the instance of the
    the NonlinearLeastSquares class.


@title
INTRODUCTION:

    Nonlinear least-squares is a widely used set of algorithms for fitting
    a model to noisy data through the minimization of a cost function.  The
    observed data is represented as a vector (denoted X in this module) and
    how the model would predict each element of X by another vector that is
    denoted Fvec.  As you would expect, each element of Fvec is a function
    of the parameters of the model.  The goal of nonlinear least-squares is
    to find the best possible values for the parameters, best in the sense
    of minimizing a cost function that is almost always the square of the
    vector norm of the different between X and Fvec.

    The simplest approach to solving a nonlinear least-squares problem is
    Gradient Descent (GD).  The mental imagery that best explains GD is to
    think of all of the model parameters as constituting a hyperplane and
    the cost function as a surface over the hyperplane.  Gradient descent
    consists of starting at some point in the hyperplane, looking straight
    up at the surface, and walking in the direction of the steepest descent
    on the surface. At each point on the hyperplane, you make the size of
    your next step proportional to the value of the gradient on the
    cost-function surface.  Assuming there are no local minima to trap your
    progress, GD will eventually get you to the point on the hyperplane
    that is directly below the global minimum for the cost function.

    Even when getting trapped in a local minimum is not an issue (because,
    let's say, you made a good choice for the starting point), the basic
    gradient-descent algorithm suffers from the shortcoming that the closer
    you get to the minimum, the smaller your steps will be, and, therefore,
    the slower your progress toward the destination.

    One way to get round this problem with gradient-descent is to use the
    Gauss-Newton formula to make a direct jump to the minimum --- assuming
    you are already sufficiently close to it.  However, should you
    inadvertently try to make a Gauss-Newton jump when still far from the
    minimum, your algorithm could become numerically unstable and crash.

    The algorithm that does a good job of combining the numerical
    robustness of gradient-descent with the speed of Gauss-Newton, while
    making sure that the latter is not invoked too early, is the
    Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. Given a start point on the
    hyperplane spanned by the model parameters, LM starts by taking a GD
    step. In subsequent iterations, before committing itself to a step, LM
    checks whether or not that step can safely be taken with GN.  If not,
    it steers the path toward GD.  However, if the condition for taking the
    GN step safely is satisfied, it goes ahead with that.  In this manner,
    LM can get to the minimum in a small number of steps, often under 10,
    whereas for the same problem and the same start point, GD might take
    more than a hundred.
    
    The NonlinearLeastSquares class in this module provides implementations
    for both the basic Gradient Descent and the more efficient
    Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms for getting to the minimum of a cost
    function.

    From a programming standpoint, the most notable feature of
    NonlinearLeastSquares is that it is domain agnostic.  That is, you
    should be able to use NonlinearLeastSquares for solving any problem
    that requires a GD or an LM solution for finding the optimum values for
    a set of model parameters through the minimization of a cost function.

    The fact that NonlinearLeastSquares is generic implies that you have to
    write a class of your own for the specific domain in which you wish to
    use NonlinearLeastSquares.  The domain specific class that you create
    must export to NonlinearLeastSquares values for the following options
    in its constructor:

    -- The observed data vector.  This vector is denoted X in the
       NonlinearLeastSquares class. 

    -- The initial values to be used for the parameters of the model.

    -- A vector of the predicted values for each of the data elements in X,
       all in functional form involving the parameters of the model.  This
       vector is denoted Fvec in the NonlinearLeastSquares class.

    -- The display function to be used for plotting the partial and the
       final results if at all such results can be displayed in the form of
       a 2D or 3D graphic with Python's matplotlib library.

    And, if you wish for NonlinearLeastSquares to use your analytically
    specified partial derivatives in the Jacobian matrix that it needs for
    the next-step calculations, your domain-specific class must also export
    that matrix to NonlinearLeastSquares.  In the absence of a
    user-supplied Jacobian matrix, NonlinearLeastSquares estimates it
    numerically. [See the implementation code for the OptimizeSurfaceFit
    class supplied with this module --- that class is an example of a
    domain-specific class that uses NonlinearLeastSquares for carrying out
    the needed optimization --- for how your own domain-specific class can
    construct a Jacobian matrix in a functional form and supply it to
    NonlinearLeastSquares.]

    The NonlinearLeastSquares class provides several setter methods that
    your own domain-specific class can use to convey the above-mentioned
    information to NonlinearLeastSquares.

    To illustrate how you may wish to write your domain specific class,
    this module also comes with a class named OptimizeSurfaceFit for
    fitting surfaces to noisy data over an xy-plane.

METHODS:

    Constructing an instance of NonlinearLeastSquares:

        optimizer =  NonlinearLeastSquares(   
                         X = None,
                         Fvec = None,
                         num_measurements = None,
                         num_parameters = None,
                         initial_params_dict = None, 
                         initial_param_values_file = None, 
                         jacobian_functionals_array = None,
                         delta_for_jacobian = 0.000001,
                         delta_for_step_size = 0.0001,
                         max_iterations = 200,
                     )

        In most usage scenarios, though, you are likely to call
        NonlinearLeastSquares directly with just the following constructor
        options and let your own domain specific class set the other
        options at run time.  That is, in your own code, you will first
        create an instance of NonlinearLeastSquares through the following
        call to its constructor:

        optimizer =  NonlinearLeastSquares(             
                         max_iterations = 400,
                         delta_for_jacobian = 0.000001,
                         delta_for_step_size = 0.0001,
                     )

        and subsequently have your own domain-specific class call the
        various setter methods of NonlinearLeastSquares for giving values
        to its other constructor options.  As to which setter methods your
        own class should call is presented in the rest of this section.

@title
CONSTRUCTOR OPTIONS:

        debug:

            When set to True, it prints out a lot of information at each
            iteration of the nonlinear least-squares algorithm invoked.

        display_function:

            If the problem you are trying to solve with nonlinear
            least-squares allows for the result of optimization to be
            visualized, use this constructor option to supply a reference
            to the function you would like to be used for such
            visualization.
    
        Fvec:
    
            This must be set to a numpy vector (actually a numpy matrix
            with just one column) whose elements are the "predictors" for
            the corresponding values of the X vector.  (We use the symbol
            'X' to denote the vector of measured data, as you will soon
            see.)  Each element of Fvec will be a function of some or all
            of the model parameters.

        initial_params_dict:
    
            This is set to a dictionary whose keys are the model parameters
            and whose values the initial values for the model parameters.
            The initial values for the model parameters specify the point
            in the parameter hyperplane where you want to start the descent
            to the minimum.

        initial_param_values_file:

            If your problem involves a very large number of parameters, it
            may be more convenient to place all their initial values in a
            text file.  Each parameter and its initial value must be in a
            line all by itself.  See the file "initial_params_gd2.txt" in
            the Examples directory for how this file needs to be formatted.

        jacobian_functionals_array:

            If you wish to specify the partial derivatives of the
            functional elements in the Fvec vector with respect to the
            model parameters, you can supply those as a numpy chararray
            through this constructor option.

        num_measurements:

            This is simply the number of data values in X.
    
        num_parameters:
    
            This is the number of model parameters that you wish to calculate
            with nonlinear least-squares.

        X:

            This variable must be set to a numpy vector (actually a numpy
            matrix with just one column) whose elements constitute the
            observed data.  The number of rows in X would be equal the
            number of data values that you are using for calculating the
            optimum values of the model parameters.

@title
METHODS:

    (1)  grad_descent():

         This is the implementation of the basic gradient-descent
         algorithm.

    (2)  leven_marq():

         This is the implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
         mentioned in the Introduction section.

    (3)  set_debug():

         This allow your own domain-specific class to set the 'debug'
         attribute of an instance of NonlinearLeastSquares.

    (4)  set_display_function():

         Some problem domains allow the result of a nonlinear least-squares
         calculation to be displayed with 2D or 3D graphics.  For example,
         if the goal is to fit an analytical form (in the form of, say, a
         polynomial) to noisy height data over a flat plane and you use the
         nonlinear least-squares algorithm to calculate the best values for
         the parameters of the analytical form, you should be able to
         visualize the quality of your results by displaying both the
         original noisy data and the model you fit to the data.  When such a
         visualization of the results is possible, you can pass the
         definition of the your display function through this setter
         function.

    (5)  set_Fvec():

         This method expects for its main argument a numpy matrix with a
         single column whose each element must be a functional form predicts
         the corresponding element in the measurement vector X.  These
         functional forms will be functions of the model parameters.

    (6)  set_initial_params():

         This method expects for its main argument a dictionary of
         <key,value> pairs in which the keys are the model parameters and
         the the corresponding values the initial values to be given to
         those parameters.

    (7)  set_jacobian_functionals_array():

         This method expects for its argument an Nxp matrix of functionals
         for the partial derivatives needed for the Jacobian matrix.  N is
         the number of measurements in the X vector and p is the number of
         parameters in the model.  If you are using nonlinear least-squares
         to fit optimal surfaces to noisy measurements over the xy-plane,
         each row of the X vector would correspond to one such measurement
         at some (x,y) coordinates. And the corresponding element in the
         argument jacobian_functionals_array (which should be a numpy
         chararray) would correspond to the partial derivative of the model
         functional that already has incorporated the (x,y) coordinates
         corresponding to that row and that is a partial derivative of the
         model with respect to the parameter corresponding to the column.

    (8)  set_num_measurements():

         This method sets the number of measurements in the X vector in the
         instance of the NonlinearLeastSquares on which the method is
         invoked.

    (9)  set_num_parameters():

         This method sets the number of model parameters that will be used
         in the nonlinear least-squares calculations.

    (10) set_X():

         This method sets the measured data vector, in the form of a numpy
         matrix consisting of only column, in an instance of
         NonlinearLeastSquares.


@title
AN EXAMPLE OF A DOMAIN SPECIFIC CLASS THAT USES NonlinearLeastSquares:

    This section presents a class named OptimizeSurfaceFit to illustrate
    how you can use the functionality of NonlinearLeastSquares in your own
    code.  The goal of OptimizeSurfaceFit is to fit a model surface to
    noisy height data over the xy-plane in the xyz-coordinate frame, with
    the model surface being described by a polynomial function.  Here are
    some examples of such polynomials:

           "a*(x-b)**2 + c*(y-d)**2 + e"

           "a*x**2 + c*y**2"

           "a*x + b*y + c"
    
    where the value returned by the polynomial for given values of the
    coordinate pair (x,y) is the height above the xy-plane at that point.
    Given the sort of a model surface shown above, the problem becomes one
    of optimally estimating the value for the model parameters from the
    noisy observed data.  If vector X represents the measured data over a
    set of (x,y) points in the form of a vector of observations, we can now
    write for the cost function:

          d^2    =    || X  -  Fvec ||^2

    where Fvec is a vector of the predictions as dictated by the model at
    each of the (x,y) point.  That is, each element of the Fvec vector is a
    prediction for the corresponding element of the measurement vector X.
    The quantity d^2 is the square of the vector norm of the prediction
    error, meaning the difference between the observations in X and the
    predictions in Fvec.  Given X and Fvec vectors, We can call on
    NonlinearLeastSquares to help us find the best values for the
    parameters of the model surface.

    A typical call to OptimizeSurfaceFit's constructor looks like:

        surface_fitter = OptimizeSurfaceFit(                         
                                gen_data_synthetically = True,
                                datagen_functional = "7.8*(x - 0.5)**3 + 2.2*(y - 0.5)**2",
                                data_array_size = (16,16),
                                how_much_noise_for_synthetic_data = 0.7,
                                model_functional = "a*(x-b)**3 + c*(y-d)**2",
                                initial_param_values = {'a':2.0, 'b':0.4, 'c':0.8, 'd':0.4},
                                display_needed = True,
                                debug = True,
                         )

    or, if you wish to also supply the partial derivatives of the model
    functional that can be used by OptimizeSurfaceFit for specifying the
    the Jacobian matrix to NonlinearLeastSquares, like

        surface_fitter = OptimizeSurfaceFit(
                                gen_data_synthetically = True,
                                datagen_functional = "7.8*(x - 0.5)**3 + 2.2*(y - 0.5)**2",
                                data_array_size = (16,16), 
                                how_much_noise_for_synthetic_data = 0.5,
                                model_functional = "a*(x-b)**3 + c*(y-d)**2",
                                initial_param_values = {'a':2.0, 'b':0.4, 'c':0.8, 'd':0.4},
                                partials_for_jacobian = {'a':'(x-b)**2', 
                                                         'b':'-2*a*(x-b)', 
                                                         'c':'(y-d)**2', 
                                                         'd':'-2*c*(y-d)'},            
                                display_needed = True,
                                debug = True,
                         )
    
    With regard to the constructor option 'partials_for_jacobian', it is
    important to realize that what is passed to OptimizeSurfaceFit's
    constructor is not directly the Nxp Jacobian matrix (where N is the
    number of observations in X and p the number of parameters in the
    model).  Instead, it is a set of partial derivatives of the model
    functional with respect to the parameters of the functional.  However,
    OptimizeSurfaceFit knows how to translate into an Nxp numpy chararray
    of the functionals needed for the Jacobian.

    The constructor options for the OptimizeSurfaceFit class:

        data_array_size:                      

           The synthetic height that is generated by OptimizeSurfaceFit is
           over a unit square in the xy-plane. Both the x and the y
           coordinates of this square range over the interval 0.0 to 1.0.
           If you set this constructor option to (16,16), the unit square
           will be sampled with a 16x16 grid in the unit square.

        datagen_functional:           

            When gen_data_synthetically is set to True, you must supply an
            algebraic expression in the form of a string that
            OptimizeSurfaceFit can use to generate the height data.  Just
            to show what such a string might look like, here is an
            example:

                       "7.8*(x - 0.5)**3 + 2.2*(y - 0.5)**2"

            You can call any function inside the string that the Python
            math library knows about.

        debug:

            This flag is passed on to the instance of
            NonlinearLeastSquares.  When set to True, it cause that class
            to display a lot of useful information during each iteration of
            the nonlinear least-squares algorithm invoked.

        display_needed:

            Fitting optimal surfaces to height data lends itself well to 3D
            visualization.  So if you'd like to see the the surfaces that
            correspond to the optimal values for the model parameters, set
            this constructor option to True.

        gen_data_synthetically:

            If set to True, OptimizeSurfaceFit can generate the measurement
            height data for your synthetically according to the function
            you specify through the constructor option 'datagen_functional'.

        how_much_noise_for_synthetic_data:                    

           This option controls the amount of noise that is added to the
           height data generated according to the datagen_functional.  The
           best way to give a meaningful value to this construction option
           is to set to some fraction of the largest coefficient in the
           datagen_functional.

        initial_param_values:   

           Through this option, you can transmit to OptimizeSurfaceFit your
           initial guesses for the values of the parameters in the model
           functional.  If you cannot think of a guess, you try setting all
           the parameters to zero.  OptimizeSurfaceFit conveys your initial
           values for the parameters to the NonlinearLeastSquares class.
           You express the initial values in the form of a dictionary,
           whole keys are the name of the parameters and whose values the
           initial values to be given to those parameters.

        initial_param_values_file:

           If the number of parameters in the problem you are addressing is
           large, it may be more convenient to supply the initial values
           for the parameters through a text file. 

        measured_data_file:

           If the amount of measured data is large, it may be more convenient
           to feed it into the module through a text file.

        model_functional:                        

           This is the algebraic expression that we want to fit to the
           noisy height data.  OptimizeSurfaceFit will call on
           NonlinearLeastSquares to estimate the best values for the
           parameters of this algebraic expression.  For example, if the
           model_functional is "a*(x-b)**3 + c*(y-d)**2", the
           NonlinearLeastSquares will find the best possible values for the
           parameters a, b, c, and d --- best in the sense of minimizing
           the cost function described previously.

        model_functional_file:

           If the model functional is too long and/or too complex to be
           specified as an option directly in a call to the constructor,
           you can also place it in a text file through the
           model_functional_file option.

        optimizer:

           Through this constructor option, you can have an instance
           variable of the same name to hold a reference to an instance of
           NonlinearLeastSquares.

        partials_for_jacobian:

           Although the NonlinearLeastSquares class can numerically
           estimate the partial derivatives of the element of the Fvec
           vector with respect to the model parameters, with this option
           you can supply your own analytical forms for the partial
           derivatives that OptimizeSurfaceFit can convert into a Jacobian
           matrix before transmitting it to NonlinearLeastSquares.

    Here are the methods defined for OptimizeSurfaceFit:

        (1) construct_Fvec():

            This method constructor the Fvec vector that
            NonlinearLeastSquares needs for comparing with the measurement
            vector X. Each element of Fvec is a prediction for the
            corresponding element of X and this prediction is a functional
            form involving model parameters.

        (2) construct_jacobian_array_in_functional_form():

            This method is used only when the user supplies analytical
            forms for the partial derivatives of the model functional with
            respect to each of the model parameters.  (When the user does
            not supply such partial derivatives, NonlinearLeastSquares
            estimates the Jacobian through numerical approximations.)

        (3) display_function()

            The problem addressed by OptimizeSurfaceFit lends itself well
            to visualization of the quality of the results returned by
            NonlinearLeastSquares.  With the definition for this method
            that is provided, you can see how well the intermediate results
            for the model parameters create a surface fit the data points
            in the 3D space defined by the xyz-coordinates.

        (4) gen_data():

            This method generates the height data over the xy-plane
            according to the analytical form that is supplied to it as its
            main argument.  We refer to this analytical form as the 'model
            functional'.

        (5) get_initial_params_from_file():

            If want to use model functions that have a large number of
            parameters, it might be easier to place their values in a text
            file and have OptimizeSurfaceFit get it from the file 
            by using this method.

        (6) get_measured_data_from_text_file():

            If you would like to supply the height data through a text file
            (rather than have the class generate it automatically for you),
            then this is the method to call for reading in the data from
            the file.  The method assumes that that individual data
            elements are separated by whitespace characters (space, tab,
            newline, etc.).  Since OptimizeSurfaceFit knows about the size
            of the array both along the x-coordinate and along the
            y-coordinate, it knows how to interpret the data in the text
            file.

        (7) get_model_functional_from_file():

            If the model functional is too long, you can get
            OptimizeSurfaceFit to read it from a text file by using this
            option.

        (8) set_constructor_options_for_optimizer()

            The responsibility of this method is to take all of the user
            supplied information and reconstitute it into a form that is
            needed by NonlinearLeastSquares taking into account the
            peculiarities of your domain.


@title
THE Examples DIRECTORY:

    See the 'Examples' directory in the distribution for examples of how
    you can use the NonlinearLeastSquares class for solving optimization
    problems.  These examples are based on the domain specific class
    OptimizeSurfaceFit that knows about fitting model surfaces to noisy
    height data over a flat plane.  You will see the following four scripts
    in this directory:

        leven_marq.py

        grad_descent.py    

        leven_marq_with_partial_derivatives.py

        grad_descent_with_partial_derivatives.py

    For the first two scripts, the NonlinearLeastSquares instance used will
    estimate the needed Jacobian matrix through appropriate numerical
    approximation formulas applied to the elements of the Fvec vector.  On
    the other hand, for the third and the fourth scripts, your own
    domain-specific class must construct the Jacobian matrix, in the form
    of an array of functions. In the case of the domain-specific class
    OptimizeSurfaceFit that comes with this module, this Jacobian matrix is
    constructed from the user-supplied partial derivatives for the model
    functional.

    In order to become familiar with the NonlinearLeastSquares class, you
    might wish to play with the four scripts listed above by:

    -- Trying different functional forms for the 'datagen_functional' for
       different shaped surfaces.

       When you change the algebraic form of 'datagen_functional' for the
       OptimizeSurfaceFit class, make sure that you also change the
       algebraic form supplied for 'model_functional'.  Note that nonlinear
       least-squares can only calculate the parameters of a model
       functional that best fit the noisy height data; it cannot conjure up
       a new mathematical form for the surface.  So the basic mathematical
       form of the 'model_functional' must be the same as that of the
       'datagen_functional'.

    -- Trying different degrees of noise.  

       As mentioned elsewhere, when you supply a numerical value for the
       constructor option 'how_much_noise_for_synthetic_data' for the
       OptimizeSurfaceFit class, the number you enter should be in
       proportion to the largest numerical coefficient in the 'datagen'
       functional.  Change this numerical value and see what happens to the
       quality of the final results.

    -- Try different values for the initial values of the model parameters.

       Since, depending on where the search for the optimum solution is
       started, all nonlinear least-squares methods can get trapped in a
       local minimum, see what happens when you change these initial
       values.
      
    -- Try different algebraic expressions for the 'model_functional'
       constructor option for the OptimizeSurfaceFit class.  But note that
       if you change the algebraic form of this functional, you must also
       change the algebraic form of the 'datagen_functional' option.

    -- Try running the example with and without the partial derivatives
       that are supplied through the 'partials_for_jacobian' option for the
       OptimizeSurfaceFit class.

INSTALLATION:

    The NonlinearLeastSquares class was packaged using setuptools.  For
    installation, execute the following command-line in the source
    directory (this is the directory that contains the setup.py file after
    you have downloaded and uncompressed the package):
 
            sudo python setup.py install
    and/or
            sudo python3 setup.py install

    On Linux distributions, this will install the module file at a location
    that looks like

             /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

    and for Python3 at a location like

             /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/

    If you do not have root access, you have the option of working directly
    off the directory in which you downloaded the software by simply
    placing the following statements at the top of your scripts that use
    the NonlinearLeastSquares class:

            import sys
            sys.path.append( "pathname_to_NonlinearLeastSquares_directory" )

    To uninstall the module, simply delete the source directory, locate
    where the NonlinearLeastSquares module was installed with "locate
    NonlinearLeastSquares" and delete those files.  As mentioned above, the
    full pathname to the installed version is likely to look like
    /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/NonlinearLeastSquares*

    If you want to carry out a non-standard install of the
    NonlinearLeastSquares module, look up the on-line information on
    Disutils by pointing your browser to

              http://docs.python.org/dist/dist.html
