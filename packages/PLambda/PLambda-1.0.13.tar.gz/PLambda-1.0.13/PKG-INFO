        PLambda
        =======
        
        An early prototype of a workable version of JLambda for Python.
        To be used mainly as a part of the IOP imaude system.
        
        JLambda and PLambda are essentially network command and control
        languages. JLambda for controlling Java processes, and PLambda for
        python processes.  JLambda is over 14 years old, whereas PLambda
        is just a pup.
        
        Note that Python is not Java so there will be some differences, but
        hopefully the spirit will shine through. 
        
        PLambda, like JLambda,  is a fast, efficient, minimalistic, call-by-value, lexically scoped Lisp or
        Scheme like language with closures built upon the underlying data structures of the language it rests upon. 
        The interpreter is implemented via CPS (continuation passing style).
        
        Install
        -------
        
        There is a pip package, but that will move along at a lazier pace than developing directly from 
        the repository.
        
        |
        | ``pip install plambda``
        |
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Python 2.7 is desired, though it might work on most pythons.
        You will need the antlr4 runtime:
        
        |
        | ``pip install antlr4-python2-runtime``
        |
        
        
        Develop
        -------
        
        Checkout the repository and do:
        
        |
        | ``make develop``
        |

        Recipe to add an operator
        -------------------------
        
        
        1. Add it to the grammar ``plambda.antlr4.PLambda.g4``
        
        2. Process the grammar with ``make antlr4``
        
        3. Add the operator to the ``plambda.eval.SymbolTable``
        
        4. Add the operator to the ``plambda.eval.Interpreter``
        
        5. Add some tests to ``tests/language.py``
