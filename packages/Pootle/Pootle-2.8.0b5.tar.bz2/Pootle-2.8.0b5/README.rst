`Pootle <http://pootle.translatehouse.org/>`_ is an online translation and
localization tool.  It works to lower the barrier of entry, providing tools to
enable teams to work towards higher quality while welcoming newcomers.


Pootle is a Server
------------------

Pootle is written in Python using the Django framework and therefore can be
installed on any web server that supports serving WSGI applications.

A number of translation projects for a number of languages can be hosted on
Pootle.  Teams can manage their files, permissions, projects, and translate
on-line.  Files can be downloaded for offline translation.

Installation can be done via pip::

  pip install Pootle

But don't forget to read the `installation guide
<http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/server/installation.html>`_
for the important details.
