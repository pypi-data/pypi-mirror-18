 11) tried NL80211_CMD_GET_WIPHY, setting _WIPHY_TX_POWER_LEVEL but did
  not return the current power level - currently cannot find anything in nl80211.h
  that could be used to get tx power
 17) distro tests
  o openSUSE
  o RedHat/Fedora
  o Debian (g2g)
  o Arch
  o CentOs (?)
  o slackware
  o dd-wrt/OpenWRT
 21) look at NL80211_CMD_START_AP - no need to try and recreate the wheel by
  replicating hostap but could be useful
 26) need to parse dumps (NLM_F_DUMP), for now we're good with link etc, so long
   as the card is connected but it may come up eventually especially if we want
   to add scan results
 29) figure out how to parse the information element in pyw.link - sometimes
     the router os and type are included
   o in link, NL80211_BSS_BEACON_IES vs NL80211_BSS_INFORMATION_ELEMENT
     BEACON_IES may not always be present but appears to contain more
 31) add VHT processing to sta_info bitrate
 39) parsing wiphy_bands (should we add the below?)
   o _HT_MCS_SET: a 16-bit attr containing the MCS set as defined in 802.11n
   o _HT_CAPA: as in the HT information IE
