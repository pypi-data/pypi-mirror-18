Jupyter Notebooks
=================

This directory contains some samples of interactive analysis conducted
in the `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`__ environment. Github does
a possible job of rendering these, so you can see what's possible
without going through the formality of actually installing the software.

For complex analysis I would encourage you to explore this environment.

Please see the documentation for notes on installing the Jupyter stack.
