Description: 
        RelStorage is a storage implementation for ZODB that stores pickles in
        a relational database. PostgreSQL 9.0 and above, MySQL 5.0.32+ /
        5.1.34+, and Oracle 10g and 11g are currently supported. RelStorage
        replaced the PGStorage project.

         Features
        ==========
        
        * It is a drop-in replacement for FileStorage and ZEO.
        * There is a simple way to convert FileStorage to RelStorage and back again.
          You can also convert a RelStorage instance to a different relational database.
        * Designed for high volume sites: multiple ZODB instances can share the same
          database. This is similar to ZEO, but RelStorage does not require ZEO.
        * According to some tests, RelStorage handles high concurrency better than
          the standard combination of ZEO and FileStorage.
        * Whereas FileStorage takes longer to start as the database grows due to an
          in-memory index of all objects, RelStorage starts quickly regardless of
          database size.
        * Supports undo, packing, and filesystem-based ZODB blobs.
        * Both history-preserving and history-free storage are available.
        * Capable of failover to replicated SQL databases.
        * ``zodbconvert`` utility to copy databases.
        * Free, open source (ZPL 2.1)
