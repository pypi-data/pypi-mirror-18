Description: # snpmatch
        
        snpmatch is a simple library to compare the given SNPs to that of database SNP matrix and identify the right accession. It is used ot genotype a sample from the low-coverage sequencing data. 
        It calculates a likelihood score with a each accession and performs a likelihood ratio test of top accession with rest. 
        
        Requirements:
        The snpmatch uses various python packages (numpy, pandas, pygwas, vcfnp)
        The main SNP database should be a HDF5 file with specific keys. Mainly read using pygwas package.
