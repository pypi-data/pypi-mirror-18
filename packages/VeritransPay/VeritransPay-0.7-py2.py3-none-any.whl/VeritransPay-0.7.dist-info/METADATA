VeritransPay
============

Client library for communicating with **VERSION 2** of the veritrans.co.id payment gateway.

Notes
-----

This is still an early release and does not provide access to all the
functionality of the Veritrans.co.id API.  Currently, only submitting
credit-card payments, and receiving that response is supported.
