This package offers helper modules for Vesta services working in a distributed
Service architecture. The work being executed by these services might be an
annotation process or a form of conversion process taking a significant amount
of time thereby benefiting from a distributed processing system with a REST
interface.

Messages are communicated through a `Celery <http://www.celeryproject.org/>`_
distributed processing queue system. Celery can be configured to run with
various backends such as RabbitMQ or Reddis. It is mainly meant to work with
the Vesta `Service Gateway <http://services.vesta.crim.ca/docs/sg/latest/>`_ .
