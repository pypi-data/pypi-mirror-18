        ========
        Overview
        ========
        
        YaCms is a powerful, consistent, and flexible content management
        platform. Built using the `Django`_ framework, YaCms provides a
        simple yet highly extensible architecture that encourages diving in
        and hacking on the code. YaCms is `BSD licensed`_ and supported by
        a diverse and active community.
        
        In some ways, YaCms resembles tools such as `Wordpress`_,
        providing an intuitive interface for managing pages, blog posts, form
        data, store products, and other types of content. But YaCms is
        also different. Unlike many other platforms that make extensive use of
        modules or reusable applications, YaCms provides most of its
        functionality by default. This approach yields a more integrated and
        efficient platform.

        people have built using YaCms`_.

        Support
        =======
        
        To **report a security issue**, please send an email privately to
        `core-team@yacms.vn`_. This gives us a chance to fix the issue
        and create an official release prior to the issue being made public.
        
        For **all other YaCms support**, the primary channel is the
        `YaCms-users`_ mailing list. Questions, comments, issues, feature
        requests, and all other related discussions should take place here.
        
        If you're **certain** you've come across a bug, then please use the
        `GitHub issue tracker`_, however it's crucial that enough information
        is provided to reproduce the bug, ideally with a small code sample repo
        we can simply fork, run, and see the issue with. Other useful
        information includes things such as the Python stack trace generated by
        error pages, as well as other aspects of the development environment
        used, such as operating system, database, and Python version. If
        **you're not sure you've found a reproducible bug**, then please try
        the mailing list first.
        
        Finally, feel free to drop by the `#YaCms IRC channel`_ on
        `Freenode`_, for a chat! Lastly, communications in all YaCms spaces
        are expected to conform to the `Django Code of Conduct`_.
        
        
        Contributing
        ============
        
        YaCms is an open source project managed using both the Git and
        Mercurial version control systems. These repositories are hosted on
        both `GitHub`_ and `Bitbucket`_ respectively, so contributing is as
        easy as forking the project on either of these sites and committing
        back your enhancements.
        
        Please note the following guidelines for contributing:
        
        * If you're fairly confident you've identified a bug or have already written a
          patch, feel free to open an issue or pull request. Otherwise, please discuss
          on the `YaCms-users`_ mailing list first.
        * Contributed code must be written in the existing style. For Python
          (and to a decent extent, JavaScript as well), this is as simple as
          following the `Django coding style`_ and (most importantly)
          `PEP 8`_. Front-end CSS should adhere to the
          `Bootstrap CSS guidelines`_.
        * Contributions must be available on a separately named branch
          based on the latest version of the main branch.
        * Run the tests before committing your changes. If your changes
          cause the tests to break, they won't be accepted.
        * If you are adding new functionality, you must include basic tests
          and documentation.
