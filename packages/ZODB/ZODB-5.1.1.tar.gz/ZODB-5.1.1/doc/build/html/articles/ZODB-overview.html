<h1>An overview of the ZODB (by Laurence Rowe)<a class="headerlink" href="#an-overview-of-the-zodb-by-laurence-rowe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>ZODB in comparison to relational databases, transactions, scalability and best
practice. Originally delivered to the Plone Conference 2007, Naples.</p>
<div class="section" id="comparison-to-other-database-types">
<h2>Comparison to other database types<a class="headerlink" href="#comparison-to-other-database-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Relational Databases</strong> are great at handling large quantities of homogenous
data. If you’re building a ledger system a Relational Database is a great fit.
But Relational Databases only support hierarchical data structures to a
limited degree. Using foreign-key relationships must refer to a single table,
so only a single type can be contained.</p>
<p><strong>Hierarchical databases</strong> (such as LDAP or a filesystem) are much more
suitable for modelling the flexible containment hierarchies required for
content management applications. But most of these systems do not support
transactional semantics. ORMs such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org">SQLAlchemy</a>. make working with Relational Databases in an
object orientated manner much more pleasant. But they don’t overcome the
restrictions inherent in a relational model.</p>
<p>The <strong>ZODB</strong> is an (almost) transparent python object persistence system,
heavily influenced by Smalltalk. As an Object-Orientated Database it gives you
the flexibility to build a data model fit your application. For the most part
you don’t have to worry about persistency - you only work with python objects
and it just happens in the background.</p>
<p>Of course this power comes at a price. While changing the methods your classes
provide is not a problem, changing attributes can necessitate writing a
migration script, as you would with a relational schema change. With ZODB
obejcts though explicit schema migrations are not enforced, which can bite you
later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transactions">
<h2>Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ZODB has a transactional support at its core. Transactions provide
concurrency control and atomicity. Transactions are executed as if they have
exclusive access to the data, so as an application developer you don’t have to
worry about threading. Of course there is nothing to prevent two simultaneous
conflicting requests, So checks are made at transaction commit time to ensure
consistency.</p>
<p>Since Zope 2.8 ZODB has implemented <strong>Multi Version Concurrency Control</strong>.
This means no more ReadConflictErrors, each transaction is guaranteed to be
able to load any object as it was when the transaction begun.</p>
<p>You may still see (Write) <strong>ConflictErrors</strong>. These can be minimised using
data structures that support conflict resolution, primarily B-Trees in the
BTrees library. These scalable data structures are used in Large Plone Folders
and many parts of Zope. One downside is that they don’t support user definable
ordering.</p>
<p>The hot points for ConflictErrors are the catalogue indexes. Some of the
indexes do not support conflict resolution and you will see ConflictErrors
under write-intensive loads. On solution is to defer catalogue updates using
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.QueueCatalog">QueueCatalog</a>
(<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.PloneQueueCatalog">PloneQueueCatalog</a>), which allows
indexing operations to be serialized using a seperate ZEO client. This can
bring big performance benefits as request retries are reduced, but the
downside is that index updates are no longer reflected immediately in the
application. Another alternative is to offload text indexing to a dedicated
search engine using <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.solr">collective.solr</a>.</p>
<p>This brings us to <strong>Atomicity</strong>, the other key feature of ZODB transactions. A
transaction will either succeed or fail, your data is never left in an
inconsistent state if an error occurs. This makes Zope a forgiving system to
work with.</p>
<p>You must though be careful with interactions with external systems. If a
ConflictError occurs Zope will attempt to replay a transaction up to three
times. Interactions with an external system should be made through a Data
Manager that participates in the transaction. If you’re talking to a database
use a Zope DA or a SQLAlchemy wrapper like <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.sqlalchemy">zope.sqlalchemy</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the default MailHost implementation used by Plone is not
transaction aware. With it you can see duplicate emails sent. If this is a
problem use TransactionalMailHost.</p>
<p>Scalability Python is limited to a single CPU by the Global Interpreter Lock,
but that’s ok, ZEO lets us run multiple Zope Application servers sharing a
single database. You should run one Zope client for each processor on your
server. ZEO also lets you connect a debug session to your database at the same
time as your Zope web server, invaluable for debugging.</p>
<p>ZEO tends to be IO bound, so the GIL is not an issue.</p>
<p>ZODB also supports <strong>partitioning</strong>, allowing you to spread data over multiple
storages. However you should be careful about cross database references
(especially when copying and pasting between two databases) as they can be
problematic.</p>
<p>Another common reason to use partitioning is because the ZODB in memory cache
settings are made per database. Separating the catalogue into another storage
lets you set a higher target cache size for catalogue objects than for your
content objects. As much of the Plone interface is catalogue driven this can
have a significant performance benefit, especially on a large site.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="storage-options">
<h2>Storage Options<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>FileStorage</strong> is the default. Everything in one big Data.fs file, which is
essentially a transaction log. Use this unless you have a very good reason not
to.</p>
<p><strong>DirectoryStorage</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="http://dirstorage.sourceforge.net">site</a>) stores one
file per object revision. Does not require the Data.fs.index to be rebuilt on
an unclean shutdown (which can take a significant time for a large database).
Small number of users.</p>
<p><strong>RelStorage</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RelStorage">pypi</a>) stores
pickles in a relational database. PostgreSQL, MySQL and Oracle are supported
and no ZEO server is required. You benefit from the faster network layers of
these database adapters. However, conflict resolution is moved to the
application server, which can be bad for worst case performance when you have
high network latency.</p>
<p>BDBStorage, OracleStorage, PGStorage and APE have now fallen by the wayside.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-features">
<h2>Other features<a class="headerlink" href="#other-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Savepoints</strong> (previously sub-transactions) allow fine grained error control
and objects to be garbage collected during a transaction, saving memory.</p>
<p>Versions are deprecated (and will be removed in ZODB 3.9). The application
layer is responsible for versioning, e.g. CMFEditions / ZopeVersionControl.</p>
<p><strong>Undo</strong>, don’t rely on it! If your object is indexed it may prove impossible
to undo the transaction (independently) if a later transaction has changed the
same index. Undo is only performed on a single database, so if you have
separated out your catalogue it will get out of sync. Fine for undoing in
portal_skins/custom though.</p>
<p><strong>BLOBs</strong> are new in ZODB 3.8 / Zope 2.11, bringing efficient large file
support. Great for document management applications.</p>
<p><strong>Packing</strong> removes old revisions of objects. Similar to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/routine-vacuuming.html">Routine Vacuuming</a> in
PostgreSQL.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="some-best-practice">
<h2>Some best practice<a class="headerlink" href="#some-best-practice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Don’t write on read</strong>. Your Data.fs should not grow on a read. Beware of
setDefault and avoid inplace migration.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your code on the filesystem</strong>. Too much stuff in the custom folder will
just lead to pain further down the track. Though this can be very convenient
for getting things done when they are needed yesterday...</p>
<p><strong>Use scalable data structures</strong> such as BTrees. Keep your content objects
simple, add functionality with adapters and views.</p>
