# Acceptance testing tools for use in unit/acceptance testing

This is a set of tools that may be useful for testing.

### Surjection

Surjection is a useful utility when you have an arbitrarily large number of options to test and want to make sure you
touch each option once without taking the time to test all combinations.

Surjection in this always means minimally surjective.

### Watcher

SubClassWatcher is useful for confirming hierarchies when specs require it.
