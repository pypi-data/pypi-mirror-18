"""
    Graphite expects everything to be just ASCII to split/processing them,
    and then make directories based on metric name. So any special name
    not allow to appear in directory/file name is not supported by Graphite.

    Limitation and explaination:

    Since we are using IDNA(International Domain Name in Application) rules,
    there are several limitations we should pay attention to.

    The conversions between ASCII and non-ASCII forms of a domain name are
    accomplished by algorithms called ToASCII and ToUnicode.
    These algorithms are not applied to the domain name as a whole, but
    rather to individual labels. For example,
    if the domain name is www.example.com, then the labels are www, example,
    and com. ToASCII or ToUnicode are applied
    to each of these three separately.

    Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name

    FAIL CASES:
    '.fd': starting with 'dot'
    'a..a': continuous 'dot'
    very long string: exceed the 63-character
"""

"""
    For special characters :
    1.  The dot (.) is a special character because it delineates each metricâ€™s
        path component, but this is an easy fix; just substitute all dots for
        underscores or '%2E'.
        For example, www.zillow.com => www_zillow_com / www%2Ezillow%2Ecom
    2   For the rest of the special characters(except dot), just URL any
        metric name with special characters to make it valid for Graphite,
        and then URL decode it when we need to reconstruct the information.
