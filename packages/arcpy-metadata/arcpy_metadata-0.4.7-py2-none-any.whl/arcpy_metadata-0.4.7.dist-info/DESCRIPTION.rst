WARNING: Version 0.4 deprecates the .get() and .set() methods used in prior versions of arcpy_metadata. You can now set values using normal Python, such as by setting metadata.title = "feature class title".

Version 0.4.6 added support for new metadata types and version 0.4.7 adds support for using arcpy.env.workspace instead of explicitly setting paths. See all metadata elements at https://github.com/ucd-cws/arcpy_metadata
