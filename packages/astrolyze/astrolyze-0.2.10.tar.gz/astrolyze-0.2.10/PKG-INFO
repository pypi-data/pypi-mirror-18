        Astrolyze is a python-package with several functions for reduction and analysis
        of (mainly) radioastronomical data analysis. It is developed over the course of
        my Diploma and PhD thesis. I decided to package the functions because I think
        that they may be useful to other astronomers. The package is open for
        collaboration.
