smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the
:ref:`changelog`. By the numbers:

* xxx pull requests have been merged since v1.2
* xxx distinct people have contributed code

New WCSAxes framework to make Matplotlib plots with WCS coordinates
-------------------------------------------------------------------


New function to contruct RGB images based on Lupton et al. (2004) algorithm
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :ref:`visualization <astropy-visualization>` subpackage now includes a
function to create RGB composite images from individual (high dynamic range)
images.  The technique is detailed in `Lupton et al. (2004)`_ and implemented in `~astropy.visualization.make_lupton_rgb`. For more details, see
:ref:`astropy-visualization-rgb`.

Change in Table behavior when setting column
--------------------------------------------

Previous to 1.3, :ref:`Tables <astropy-table>` did in-place
modification of a table column when a column was set like
``tab['colname'] = val``.  In 1.3, the default behavior has been set to instead
*replace* a column.  That is, ``tab['colname'] = val`` is now more like
``t.replace_column('a', val)`` than ``tab['colname'][:] = val``.  This behavior
can be turned off for compatibility using the ``table.replace_inplace``
configuration setting (although is future versions of Astropy this capability
will be deprecated and removed).  For more details and examples on this change,
see :ref:`table-replace-1_3`.


Coordinate transformations can use JPL Ephemerides
--------------------------------------------------


Earth locations can now be obtained by address
----------------------------------------------


Support for Fortran exponent formats in ASCII tables
----------------------------------------------------

The :ref:`fast reader <fast_ascii_io>` in :ref:`io.ascii <io-ascii>` now
supports FORTRAN-style floating point values (i.e. ``1.495978707D+13``), via
the ``fast_reader`` option ``exponent_style``.  The fast reader also now
supports extended precision to fully read fortran outputs. For more details see
:ref:`fortran_style_exponents`.


Serialization of Astropy classes to YAML
----------------------------------------


Performance improvements with lazy-loading in the io.fits sub-package
---------------------------------------------------------------------


.. _whatsnew-1.3-cosmo:

Improvements to cosmology sub-package
-------------------------------------

The default cosmology in the :ref:`astropy-cosmology` sub-package is
now the Planck 2015 cosmology, and the references have been updated
to reflect the published papers.

Improvements to coordinates sub-package
---------------------------------------

The `astropy.coordinates.GCRS` and `astropy.coordinates.PrecessedGeocentric`
frames have been subtly changed such that their ``obsgeoloc`` and ``obsgeovel``
attributes return ``CartesianRepresentation`` objects, rather than ``Quantity``
objects.  This was judged to be an advanced enough use case that this change
will not include a deprecation period (as this would have added substantial
complexity to `astropy.coordinates`). To make code written for earlier versions
compatible with v1.3 and up, simply change all instances of
``<object>.obsgeoloc`` or ``<object>.obsgeovel`` to
``<object>.obsgeoloc.xyz``/``<object>.obsgeovel.xyz``.
