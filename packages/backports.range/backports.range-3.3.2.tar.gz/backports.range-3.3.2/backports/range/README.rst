Backports the python 3.X ``range`` class as a replacement for python 2.X ``range``
functions. The ``range`` class is similar to ``xrange`` in that its values are
computed on demand - however, the ``range`` class is actually a lazy sequence:
it supports indexing, membership testing and other sequence features.

Thus, it can be used to replace both `range` and `xrange`.

Features
--------

This implementation provides all features introduced and documented in
python 3.3.

All objects are available by default in a pure python implementation.
In addition, there are optional, optimized implementations using `Cython`_.

Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``backports.range`` is adequate in performance for most applications.
It is comparable in speed to builtins when using `PyPy`_ or `Cython`_, but somewhat slower for small ranges of less than 1000 elements.
This should not be noticeable in all but the most high-performance applications.

When using CPython (aka plain ``python``), pure python mode is considerably slower than the builtins.
Again, this should not matter for most applications, but the use of `Cython`_ is **strongly** advised.

Cython Optimizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All `Cython`_ optimizations are optional.
They are automatically made available if `Cython`_ is installed.

- Iteration in the C long long range `[-9223372036854775807, 9223372036854775807]`

Compatibility
-------------

- Features are tested against the Python 3.6 unittests for ``range``.

- The following python versions are tested explicitly:

  - CPython (aka python): 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5

  - `Cython`_: All versions supported by cpython

  - `PyPy`_: pypy2, pypy3

- Some features depending on language features or other modules may not be
  available or work differently:

  - Comparing ``range`` against other types does not throw ``TypeError`` in python 2.X.
