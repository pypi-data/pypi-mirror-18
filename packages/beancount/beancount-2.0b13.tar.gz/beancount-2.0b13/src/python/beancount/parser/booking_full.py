"""Full (new) booking implementation.

Problem description:

Interpolation and booking feed on each other, that is, numbers filled in from
interpolation might affect the booking process, and numbers derived from the
booking process may help carry out interpolation that would otherwise be
under-defined. Here's an example of interpolation helping the booking process:

Assume the ante-inventory of Assets:Investments contains two lots of shares of
HOOL, one at 100.00 USD and the other at 101.00 USD and apply this transaction:

    2015-09-30 *
      Assets:Investments   -10 HOOL {USD}
      Assets:Cash               1000 USD
      Income:Gains              -200 USD

Interpolation is unambiguously able to back out a cost of 100 USD / HOOL, which
would then result in an unambiguous booking result.

On the other hand, consider this transaction:

    2015-09-30 *
      Assets:Investments    -10 HOOL {USD}
      Assets:Cash               1000 USD
      Income:Gains

Now the interpolation cannot succeed. If the Assets:Investments accoujnt is
configured to use the FIFO method, the 10 oldest shares would be selected for
the cost, and we could then interpolate the capital gains correctly.

First observation: The second case is much more frequent than the first, and the
first is easily resolved manually by requiring a particular cost be specified.
Moreover, in many cases there isn't just a single lot of shares to be reduced
from and figuring out the correct set of shares given a target cost is an
underspecified problem.

Second observation: Booking can only be achieved for inventory reductions, not
for augmentations. Therefore, we should carry out booking on inventory
reductions and fail early if reduction is undefined there, and leave inventory
augmentations with missing numbers undefined, so that interpolation can fill
them in at a later stage.

Note that one case we'd like to but may not be able to handle is of a reduction
with interpolated price, like this:

    2015-09-30 *
      Assets:Investments        -10 HOOL {100.00 # USD}
      Expenses:Commission      9.95 USD
      Assets:Cash            990.05 USD

Therefore we choose to

1) Carry out booking first, on inventory reductions only, and leave inventory
   augmentations as they are, possibly undefined. The 'cost' attributed of
   booked postings are converted from CostSpec to Cost. Augmented postings with
   missing amounts are left as CostSpec instances in order to allow for
   interpolation of total vs. per-unit amount.

2) Compute interpolations on the resulting postings. Undefined costs for
   inventory augmentations may be filled in by interpolations at this stage (if
   possible).

3) Finally, convert the interpolated CostSpec instances to Cost instances.

Improving on this algorithm would require running a loop over the booking and
interpolation steps until all numbers are resolved or no more inference can
occur. We may consider that for later, as an experimental feature. My hunch is
that there are so few cases for which this would be useful that we won't bother
improving on the algorithm above.
