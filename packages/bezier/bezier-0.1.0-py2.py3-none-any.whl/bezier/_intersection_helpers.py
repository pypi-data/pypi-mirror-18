def linearization_error(curve):
    r"""Compute the maximum error of a linear approximation.

    We use the line

    .. math::

       L(s) = v_0 (1 - s) + v_n s

    and compute a bound on the maximum error

    .. math::

       \max_{s \in \left[0, 1\right]} \|B(s) - L(s)\|_2.

    Rather than computing the actual maximum (a tight bound), we
    use an upper bound via the remainder from Lagrange interpolation
    in each component. This leaves us with :math:`\frac{s(s - 1)}{2!}`
    times the second derivative in each component.

    The second derivative curve is degree :math:`d = n - 2` and
    is given by

    .. math::

       B''(s) = n(n - 1) \sum_{j = 0}^{d} \binom{d}{j} s^j
       (1 - s)^{d - j} \cdot \Delta^2 v_j

    Due to this form (and the convex combination property of
    B |eacute| zier Curves) we know each component of the second derivative
    will be bounded by the maximum of that component among the
    :math:`\Delta^2 v_j`.

    For example, the curve

    .. math::

       B(s) = \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] (1 - s)^2
           + \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 3 \end{array}\right] 2s(1 - s)
           + \left[\begin{array}{c} -2 \\ 9 \end{array}\right] s^2

    has
    :math:`B''(s) \equiv \left[\begin{array}{c} -8 \\ 6 \end{array}\right]`
    which has norm :math:`10` everywhere, hence the maximum error is

    .. math::

       \left.\frac{s(1 - s)}{2!} \cdot 10\right|_{s = \frac{1}{2}}
