def vector_close(vec1, vec2, eps=_EPS):
    r"""Checks that two vectors are equal to some threshold.

    Does so by computing :math:`s_1 = \|v_1\|_2` and
    :math:`s_2 = \|v_2\|_2` and then checking if

    .. math::

       \|v_1 - v_2\|_2 \leq \varepsilon \min(s_1, s_2)

    where :math:`\varepsilon = 2^{-40} \approx 10^{-12}` is a fixed
    threshold. In the rare case that one of ``vec1`` or ``vec2`` is
    the zero vector (i.e. when :math:`\min(s_1, s_2) = 0`) instead
    checks that the other vector is close enough to zero:

    .. math::

       \|v_1\|_2 = 0 \Longrightarrow \|v_2\|_2 \leq \varepsilon

    .. note::

       This function assumes that both vectors have finite values,
       i.e. that no NaN or infinite numbers occur. NumPy provides
       :func:`np.allclose` for coverage of **all** cases.

    Args:
        vec1 (numpy.ndarray): First vector for comparison.
        vec2 (numpy.ndarray): Second vector for comparison.
        eps (float): Error threshold. Defaults to :math:`2^{-40}`.

        bool: Flag indicating if they are close to precision.

       for round-off.
