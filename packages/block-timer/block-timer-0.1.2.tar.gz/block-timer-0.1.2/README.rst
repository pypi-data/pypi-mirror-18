Installation
------------

- Supported Python versions are: ``3.5``, ``3.6-dev`` and ``3.7-dev``.

.. code:: shell

    pip install --upgrade block-timer

Usage
-----

You can easily measure blocks of code using ``Timer`` class as context manager or as method/function decorator with Block Timer:

Elapsed time will be printed using standard ``print`` function:

.. code:: python

    from block_timer.timer import Timer

    with Timer():
        pass # Some operation

    # Total time ... seconds will be printed

If you have multiple blocks of code, you can set ``title`` attribute:

.. code:: python

    from block_timer.timer import Timer

    with Timer(title="Block A"):
        pass # Some operation

    # [Block A] Total time ... seconds will be printed

    with Timer(title="Block B"):
        pass # Some operation

    # [Block B] Total time ... seconds will be printed

Elapsed time (in fractional seconds) can be accessed by ``elapsed`` property:

.. code:: python

    from block_timer.timer import Timer

    with Timer() as t:
        pass # Some operation

    print("Elapsed time: {:f} seconds".format(t.elapsed))


``Timer`` class can be used as a method/function decorator:

.. code:: python

    @Timer(title="Foo")
    def some_func():
        time.sleep(1)
        
    some_func()
    # [Foo] Total time ... seconds will be printed
