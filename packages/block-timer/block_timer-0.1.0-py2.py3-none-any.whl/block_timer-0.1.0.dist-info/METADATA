Introduction
------------

You can easily measure blocks of code using ``Timer`` class as context manager or as method/function decorator:

.. code:: python

    from block_timer.timer import Timer

    with Timer() as t:
        pass # Some long running operation

    # Total time ... seconds will be printed
    # or you can use elapsed property:
    print(t.elapsed)

Installation
------------

- Supported Python versions are: **only** ``3.5``.

.. code:: shell

    pip install --upgrade block-timer
