    High-level call to simple name verification:
    Given a trusted serial number, txid, or consensus_hash, use it as a trust root to verify that
    a previously-registered but untrusted name (@verify_name) exists and was processed
    at a given block (@verify_block_id)

    Basically, use the trust root to derive a "current" block ID and consensus hash, and
    use the untrusted (name, block_id) pair to derive an earlier untrusted block ID and
    consensus hash.  Then, use the snv_get_nameops_at() method to verify that the name
    existed at the given block ID.

    The Blockstack node is not trusted.  This algorithm prevents a malicious Blockstack node
    from getting the caller to falsely trust @verify_name and @verify_block_id by
    using SNV to confirm that:
    * the consensus hash at the trust root's block is consistent with @verify_name's
    corresponding NAMESPACE_PREORDER or NAME_PREORDER;
    * the consensus hash at @trusted_serial_number's block is consistent with @verify_name's
    consensus hash (from @verify_serial_number)

    The only way a Blockstack node working with a malicious Sybil can trick the caller is if
    both can create a parallel history of name operations such that the final consensus hash
    at @trusted_serial_number's block collides.  This is necessary, since the client uses
    the hash over a block's operations and prior consensus hashes to transitively trust
    prior consensus hashes--if the later consensus hash is assumed out-of-band to be valid,
    then the transitive closure of all prior consensus hashes will be assumed valid as well.
    This means that the only way to drive the valid consensus hash from a prior invalid
    consensus hash is to force a hash collision somewhere in the transitive closure, which is infeasible.

    NOTE: @trusted_txid is needed for isolating multiple operations in the same name within a single block.
