This plugin implements a profiler for buildbot master.

- It uses statistical profiling loosely based on plop https://github.com/bdarnell/plop
- Suitable for prod as statistical profiling is very low overhead
- Profiles all threads including main thread and db threads
- Removes noise samples when the threads are actually in the main loop
- In-browser UI based on nvd3 and d3-flame-graph
- Show cpu and memory percent over time
- flame graph can be restricted to a subset of the trace
- Detailed caller/callee are displayed when clicking on a function
