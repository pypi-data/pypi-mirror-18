Description: Simple executor for yaml defined builds, plugs easily into existing CI
        systems like Bamboo or Jenkins. Everything is intended to be built fully
        isolated in fresh docker containers on each build.
        
        The docker socket is mounted internally so if docker is installed in
        the container, docker can be used from the host system.
