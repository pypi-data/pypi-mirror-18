casserole
=========

`casserole <https://github.com/coleifer/casserole>`_ abstracts the process of
reading configuration values from multiple sources. ``casserole`` will also
dynamically create an ``OptionParser`` from your settings definitions.

The goal of the project is to:

> Eliminate code duplication when handling run-time configuration from various
  sources, (i.e. command-line options, environment variables, JSON files) and
  allow programmers to define their application's settings using memorable APIs.
