Contributors Welcomed!
----------------------

This package was originally created as a contribution to the main ChatterBot package.
It was converted to a optional module in order to preserve the code quality of the
main project. This weather adapter for ChatterBot works, but could benefit from
improvements in several areas.

- Improved documentation with descriptions and information about the functions and structure of the adapter
- Additional support for other weather APIs
- Support for a wider range of questions about the weather (current, future, specific dates, etc.)
