Description: # choix
        
        `choix` is a Python library that provides inference algorithms for models based
        on Luce's choice axiom. These (probabilistic) models can be used to explain and
        predict outcomes of comparisons between items.
        
        - **Pairwise comparisons**: when the data consists of comparisons between two
          items, the model variant is usually referred to as the *Bradley-Terry* model.
          It is closely related to the Elo rating system used to rank chess players.
        - **Partial rankings**: when the data consists of rankings over (a subset of)
          the items, the model variant is usually referred to as the *Plackett-Luce*
          model.
        - **Top-1 lists**: another variation of the model arises when the data consists
          of discrete choices, i.e., we observe the selection of one item out of a
          subset of items.
        
        `choix` makes it easy to infer model parameters from these different types of
        data, using a variety of algorithms:
        
        - Luce Spectral Ranking
        - Minorization-Maximization
        - Rank Centrality
        - GMM using rank breaking
        - Approximate bayesian inference with expectation propagation
        
        ## Installation
        
        Simply type
        
            pip install choix
        
        The library is under active development, use at your own risk.
