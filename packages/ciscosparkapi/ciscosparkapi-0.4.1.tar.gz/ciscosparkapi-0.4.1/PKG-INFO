        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Sure, working with the Cisco Spark APIs is easy (see `developer.ciscospark.com`_).  They are RESTful,  naturally structured, require only a simple Access Token for authentication, and the data is elegantly represented in intuitive JSON.  What could be easier?
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import requests
        
            URL = 'https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/messages'
            ACCESS_TOKEN = '<your_access_token>'
            ROOM_ID = '<room_id>'
            MESSAGE_TEXT = '<message_text>'
        
            headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + ACCESS_TOKEN,
                       'Content-type': 'application/json;charset=utf-8'}
            post_data = {'roomId': ROOM_ID,
                         'text': MESSAGE_TEXT}
            response = requests.post(URL, json=post_data, headers=headers)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                # Great your message was posted!
                message_id = response.json['id']
                message_text = response.json['text']
                print("New message created, with ID:", message_id)
                print(message_text)
            else:
                # Oops something went wrong...  Better do something about it.
                print(response.status_code, response.text)
        
        Like I said, EASY.  However, in use, the code can become rather repetitive...
        
        - You have to setup the environment every time
        - You have to remember URLs and request arguments (or reference the docs)
        - You have to parse the returned JSON and setup variables to hold the attributes you need
        - When requesting lists of items, you have to deal with pagination_
        
        
        Enter **ciscosparkapi**, a simple API wrapper that wraps all of the Spark API calls and returned JSON objects within native Python objects and function calls.
        
        With ciscosparkapi, the above Python code can be consolidated to the following:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from ciscosparkapi import CiscoSparkAPI
        
            api = CiscoSparkAPI()
            try:
                message = api.messages.create('<room_id>', text='<message_text>')
                print("New message created, with ID:", message.id)
                print(message.text)
            except SparkApiError as e:
                print(e)
        
        The ciscosparkapi package handles all of this for you:
        
        + Reads your Spark access token from a ``SPARK_ACCESS_TOKEN`` environment variable
        + Wraps and represents all Spark API calls as a simple hierarchical tree of native-Python methods (with default arguments provided everywhere possible!)
        + If your Python IDE supports **auto-completion** (like PyCharm_), you can navigate the available methods and object attributes right within your IDE
        + Represents all returned JSON objects as native Python objects - you can access all of the object's attributes using native *dot.syntax*
        + **Automatic and Transparent Pagination!**  When requesting 'lists of objects' from Spark, requests for additional pages of responses are efficiently and automatically requested as needed
        + Multipart encoding and uploading of local files, when creating messages with local file attachments
        
        All of this, combined, lets you do powerful things simply:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from ciscosparkapi import CiscoSparkAPI
        
            api = CiscoSparkAPI()
        
            # Find all rooms that have 'ciscosparkapi Demo' in their title
            all_rooms = api.rooms.list()
            demo_rooms = [room for room in all_rooms if 'ciscosparkapi Demo' in room.title]
        
            # Delete all of the demo rooms
            for room in demo_rooms:
                api.rooms.delete(room.id)
        
            # Create a new demo room
            demo_room = api.rooms.create('ciscosparkapi Demo')
        
            # Add people to the new demo room
            email_addresses = ["test01@cmlccie.com", "test02@cmlccie.com"]
            for email in email_addresses:
                api.memberships.create(demo_room.id, personEmail=email)
        
            # Post a message to the new room, and upload a file
            api.messages.create(demo_room.id, text="Welcome to the room!",
                                files=["https://developer.ciscospark.com/images/logo_spark_lg@256.png"])
        
        That's more than six Spark API calls in less than 23 lines of script code (with comments)!
        ...and likely more than that depending on how many rooms are returned by Spark (remember pagination is handled for you automatically)
