DOCUMENTATION

This python package contains functions to classify chimera states,
non-linear hybrid states of coexisting coherence and incoherence.
In partical, this package offers three functions, following the paper

"A classification scheme for chimera states"
http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4959804

-spatial(A, boundaries='no-flux', phases=False, nbins=100)

A must be a TxN or a TxN1xN2 numpy matrix (either real or complex).
The function spatial() applies the discrete Laplacian on the data, and returns the coherent
fraction at each time step. boundaries specifies the boundary conditions under which the data was
generated. Set phases=True if A contains phases only. nbins specifies the number of bins of the histograms
which are generated.

-globaldist(A, nbins=100, phases=False, Ncoarse=1500)

A must be a TxN numpy matrix.
The function globaldist() calculates all pariwise Euclidean distances between all data points at
each time step, and returns
the coherent fraction of A at each time step.
nbins specifies the number of bins of the histograms.
Set phases=True if A contains phases only.
Ncoarse is a threshold above which the data is coarsed due to memory limitations. This can be increased,
but may lead to long calculation times or memory errors.

temporal(A, nbins=100, phases=False, Ncoarse=1500)

A must be a TxN or TxN1xN2 numpy matrix.
The function temporal calculates all pairwise temporal correlation coefficients between
the T-long timeseries of A. It returns a hisogram, with the square root of the last bin indicating the
amount of temporarily correlated time series.
nbins specifies the number of bins of the histograms.
Set phases=True if A contains phases only.
Ncoarse is a threshold above which the data is coarsed due to memory limitations. This can be increased,
but may lead to long calculation times or memory errors.
