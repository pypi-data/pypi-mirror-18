compdb: the compilation database Swiss army knife
=================================================

compdb_ is a command line tool to manipulates compilation databases.
A compilation database is a database for compile options,
it has records of which compile options are used to build the files in a project.
An example of compilation database is the `JSON Compilation Database`_

``compdb`` aims to make it easier for you to run tools on your codebase
by spoon-feeding you the right compile options.

``compdb`` is not so much about generating the initial compilation database,
this, is left to other tools, such as ``cmake`` and ``ninja``.
It is only a glue between the initial compilation database and your tool.


Motivation
----------

With the proliferation of Clang-based tools,
it has become apparent that the compile options
are no longer useful uniquely to the compiler.

Standalone tools such as clang-tidy_
or text editors with libclang_ integration have to deal with compile options.

Examples of such tools, dealing with compilation databases are:
irony-mode_, rtags_ and ycmd_.

Based on this evidence, ``compdb`` came to life.
A tool that has knowledge of the compile options and can share it
both to inform the text editor and to run clang based tool from the shell.
