====================================
Getting started with Git development
====================================

This section and the next describe in detail how to set up git for working
with the CompMech source code. If you have git already set up, skip to
:ref:`development-workflow`.

Basic Git setup
###############

* :ref:`install-git`.
* Introduce yourself to Git::

      git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
      git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"

.. _forking:

Making your own copy (fork) of CompMech
#######################################

You need to do this only once.  The instructions here are very similar
to the instructions at http://help.github.com/forking/ - please see that
page for more detail.  We're repeating some of it here just to give the
specifics for the CompMech_ project, and to suggest some default names.

Set up and configure a github_ account
======================================

If you don't have a github_ account, go to the github_ page, and make one.

You then need to configure your account to allow write access - see the
``Generating SSH keys`` help on `github help`_.

Create your own forked copy of CompMech_
========================================

#. Log into your github_ account.
#. Go to the CompMech_ github home at `CompMech github`_.
#. Click on the *fork* button:

   .. image:: forking_button.png

   After a short pause, you should find yourself at the home page for
   your own forked copy of CompMech_.

.. _set-up-fork:

Set up your fork
################

First you follow the instructions for :ref:`forking`.

Overview
========

::

   git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/compmech.git
   cd compmech
   git remote add upstream git://github.com/compmech/compmech.git

In detail
=========

Clone your fork
---------------

#. Clone your fork to the local computer with ``git clone
   git@github.com:your-user-name/compmech.git``
#. Investigate.  Change directory to your new repo: ``cd compmech``. Then
   ``git branch -a`` to show you all branches.  You'll get something
   like::

      * master
      remotes/origin/master

   This tells you that you are currently on the ``master`` branch, and
   that you also have a ``remote`` connection to ``origin/master``.
   What remote repository is ``remote/origin``? Try ``git remote -v`` to
   see the URLs for the remote.  They will point to your github_ fork.

   Now you want to connect to the upstream `CompMech github`_ repository, so
   you can merge in changes from trunk.

.. _linking-to-upstream:

Linking your repository to the upstream repo
--------------------------------------------

::

   cd compmech
   git remote add upstream git://github.com/compmech/compmech.git

``upstream`` here is just the arbitrary name we're using to refer to the
main CompMech_ repository at `CompMech github`_.

Note that we've used ``git://`` for the URL rather than ``git@``.  The
``git://`` URL is read only.  This means we that we can't accidentally
(or deliberately) write to the upstream repo, and we are only going to
use it to merge into our own code.

Just for your own satisfaction, show yourself that you now have a new
'remote', with ``git remote -v show``, giving you something like::

   upstream	git://github.com/compmech/compmech.git (fetch)
   upstream	git://github.com/compmech/compmech.git (push)
   origin	git@github.com:your-user-name/compmech.git (fetch)
   origin	git@github.com:your-user-name/compmech.git (push)

.. include:: git_links.inc
