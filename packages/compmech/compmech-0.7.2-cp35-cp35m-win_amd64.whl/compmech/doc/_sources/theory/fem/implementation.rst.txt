Implementation
==============

Definitions
-----------

`J_{ij}` - component of the Jacobian matrix
`j_{ij}` - component of the inverse of the Jacobian matrix

The numerical integration should be efficiently vectorized by grouping the
elements of the same type in a single call to the corresponding function that
will perform the numerical integration. The required parameters for this
integration are:

- inverse of the Jacobian calculated at each integration point
- Constitutive relations at each integration point
- For elements such as cylindrical, conical or with double curvature, the
  radius or radii at each integration point

Each element will pass an array with the inverse of the Jacobian
for each integration point, e.g. for a shell element:

.. math::

  \{{j_{11}}_1, {j_{12}}_1, {j_{21}}_1, {j_{22}}_1,
  \\
    {j_{11}}_2, {j_{12}}_2, {j_{21}}_2, {j_{22}}_2,
  \\
    {j_{11}}_3, {j_{12}}_3, {j_{21}}_3, {j_{22}}_3,
  \\
    \cdots,
  \\
    {j_{11}}_{n_{ip}}, {j_{12}}_{n_{ip}}, {j_{21}}_{n_{ip}}, {j_{22}}_{n_{ip}},
  \}
