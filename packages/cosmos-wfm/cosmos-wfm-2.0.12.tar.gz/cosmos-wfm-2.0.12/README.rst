Introduction
============

COSMOS is a workflow management system for Python.  It allows you to efficiently program complex workflows of command line tools that automatically take
advantage of a compute cluster, and provides a web dashboard to monitor, debug, and analyze your jobs.  COSMOS is
able to scale on a traditional cluster such as LSF or GridEngine with a shared filesystem.  It is especially
powerful when combined with spot instances on `Amazon Web Services <aws.amazon.com>`_ and
`StarCluster <http://star.mit.edu/cluster/>`_.

COSMOS was designed to solve the problem of compute-intensive and complex scientific data pipelines.  It's primary objective is to provide a simple but
flexible api to specify complex job DAGs, a way to resume modified or failed workflows, and make debugging and provenance as easy as possible.


History
___________

COSMOS was published as an Application Note in the journal `Bioinformatics <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/>`_,
but has evolved a lot since it's original inception.  If you use COSMOS
for research, please cite it's `manuscript <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/29/bioinformatics.btu385>`_. 

Since the original publication, it has been re-written and open-sourced by the original author, in a collaboration between
`The Lab for Personalized Medicine <http://lpm.hms.harvard.edu/>`_ at Harvard Medical School, the `Wall Lab <http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/>`_ at Stanford University, and
`Invitae <http://invitae.com>`_, a clinical genetic sequencing diagnostics laboratory.

Features
_________
* Written in python which is easy to learn, powerful, and popular.  A programmer with limited experience can begin writing COSMOS workflows right away.
* Powerful syntax for the creation of complex and highly parallelized workflows.
* Reusable recipes and definitions of tools and sub workflows allows for DRY code.
* Keeps track of workflows, job information, and resource utilization and provenance in an SQL database.
* The ability to visualize all jobs and job dependencies as a convenient image.
* Monitor and debug running workflows, and a history of all workflows via a web dashboard.
* Alter and resume failed workflows.

Multi-platform Support
+++++++++++++++++++++++

* Support for DRMS such as SGE, LSF.  DRMAA coming soon.  Adding support for more DRMs is very straightforward.
* Supports for MySQL, PosgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite by using the SQLALchemy ORM.
* Extremely well suited for cloud computing, especially when used in conjuection with `AWS <http://aws.amazon.com>`_ and `StarCluster <http://star.mit.edu/cluster/>`_.

Changelog
__________

2.0.1
++++++
Some pretty big changes here, incurred during a hackathon at Invitae where a lot of feedback and contributions were received.  Primarily, the api was simplified and made
more intuitive.  A new COSMOS primitive was created called a Dependency, which we have found extremely useful for generalizing subworkflow recipes.
This API is now considered to be much more stable.

* Renamed Execution -> Workflow
* Reworked Workflow.add_task() api, see its docstring.
* Renamed task.tags -> task.params.
* Require that a task's params do not have keywords that do not exist in a task's functions parameters.
* Require that a user specify a task uid (unique identifer), which is now used for resuming instead of a Task's params.
* Created cosmos.api.Dependency, which provides a way to specify a parent and input at the same time.
* Removed one2one, one2many, etc. helpers.  Found this just confused people more than helped.
* Various stability improvements to the drmaa jobmanager module
