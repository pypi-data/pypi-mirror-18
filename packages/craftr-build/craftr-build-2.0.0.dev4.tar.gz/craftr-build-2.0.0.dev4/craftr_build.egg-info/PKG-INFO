Description: Craftr 2.x
        ==========
        
        |CII Best Practices|
        
            Note: Craftr 2.x is different from the initial Craftr version in
            many ways and can not be used interchangibly. The latest version of
            Craftr 1.x can be found under the
            `v1.1.4-unreleased <https://github.com/craftr-build/craftr/tree/v1.1.4-unreleased>`__
            tag.
        
        Craftr is a meta build system based on `Python
        3 <https://www.python.org/>`__ scripts which produces
        `Ninja <https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja>`__ build manifests. It
        enforces the use of modular build definitions that can be re-used
        easily. Craftr provides a standard library to support various
        programming languages and common libraries out of the box:
        
        -  C/C++ (cURL, DLib, GoogleTest, GoogleBenchmark, tiny-dnn, Qt5, Boost,
           getopt)
        -  Cython
        -  C#
        -  Java
        -  Vala
        
        Check out the
        `Documentation <https://github.com/craftr-build/craftr/tree/master/doc>`__
        and the `Getting
        Started <https://github.com/craftr-build/craftr/tree/master/doc/getting-started.md>`__
        page.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Craftr 2.x is currently not on PyPI so you have to install it from the
        Git repository. Note that the most recent version of Craftr might also
        require an unreleased version of the ``nr`` module, thus it is
        recommended to install it from the Git repository as well.
