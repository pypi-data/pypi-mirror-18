Generating keys:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before sending or receiving encrypted messages, one must generate a
personal key pair.

::

    cryptoclip generate [myname]

Sending a message:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To send a message to someone, they must first provide you with a copy of
their **public** key (*.pubkey*) – after that, you can encrypt messages
that only they will be able to decrypt.

::

    cryptoclip encrypt [theirname]

This will copy the encrypted message to your clipboard, which you can
send to the recipient via any means. The contents cannot be read or
altered in transit, and only the holder of the recipient’s key may
decrypt it.

Receiving a message:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To receive an encrypted message, the sender must provide you with an
encrypted message block that was made out to *your* public key. To
decrypt the content, you must your your **private** key.

::

    cryptoclip decrypt [myname]

This will decrypt the message and copy the result to your clipboard.
