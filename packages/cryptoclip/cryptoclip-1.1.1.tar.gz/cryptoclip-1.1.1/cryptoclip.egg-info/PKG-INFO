Description: cryptoclip
        ==========
        
        ComboCrypt is a high-strength asymmetrical encryption scheme
        
        cryptoclip provides a command-line tool to encrypt/decrypt text from
        your clipboard with ComboCrypt
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            pip install cryptoclip
        
        
        
        Usage Tutorial
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Generating keys:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Before sending or receiving encrypted messages, one must generate a
        personal key pair.
        
        ::
        
            cryptoclip generate [myname]
        
        Sending a message:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        To send a message to someone, they must first provide you with a copy of
        their **public** key (*.pubkey*) – after that, you can encrypt messages
        that only they will be able to decrypt.
        
        ::
        
            cryptoclip encrypt [theirname]
        
        This will copy the encrypted message to your clipboard, which you can
        send to the recipient via any means. The contents cannot be read or
        altered in transit, and only the holder of the recipient’s key may
        decrypt it.
        
        Receiving a message:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        To receive an encrypted message, the sender must provide you with an
        encrypted message block that was made out to *your* public key. To
        decrypt the content, you must your your **private** key.
        
        ::
        
            cryptoclip decrypt [myname]
        
        This will decrypt the message and copy the result to your clipboard.
