Description: =====================================
        Cycloudpickle - Cloudpickle on Cython
        =====================================
        
        This module is a cythonized version of `<https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle>`_ and
        ``pickle._Pickler`` and is meant to be a drop in replacement which is about twice as fast.
        
        The cloudpickle license is included in ``cycloudpickle.cycloudpickle``. The Python software
        foundation license applies to the adaptation of ``pickle._Pickler``.
        
        While cloudpickle is compatible with python 2, cycloudpickle is *not* due the adaptation of the
        ``pickle._Pickler`` from python 3. Python 2 support should be 'doable', but a bit difficult
        because of the use of cdef classes and the inheritance between ``CloudPickler`` and ``Pickler``.
