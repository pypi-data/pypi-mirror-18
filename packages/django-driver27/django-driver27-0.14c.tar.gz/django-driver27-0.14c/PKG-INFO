        # History
        Driver 27 is a reference to car number of Gilles Villeneuve, F1 Driver died in 1982. Gilles is considered one of best driver despite he never won the World Championship, something that Jacques Villeneuve, his son, did in 1998.
        
        In 1980's decade, F1 teams kept their numbers unless they were champions. This made Ferrari, the most legendary team of the F1, take that number for many years (1981-1995), making the number an icon of this sport.
