Description: django-exchange-maploom
        ==============
        
        This is a fork of GeoSHAPE Maploom to use with Exchange before changes are added upstream to GeoSHAPE.
        
        A Django wrapper for [MapLoom](https://github.com/boundlessgeo/MapLoom).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Install the latest stable version from PIP: 
        
        ```pip install django-exchange-maploom```
        
        Download django-maploom and install it directly from source:
        
        ```python setup.py install```
        
        Project Configuration
        ---------------------
        
        Once installed you can configure your project to use 
        django-maploom with the following steps.
        
        Add ``maploom`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your project's
        ``settings`` module:
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                'maploom',
                # other apps
            )
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Once installed, you can easily add maploom to any template on your site.
        
        First load the template tags in your template:
        
        	{% load maploom_tags %}
        
        In the ```<head>``` section of your html section add the MapLoom js files:
        
            {% maploom_js %}
        
        Then add a map loom map to your page by placing the following tag anywhere in the ```<body>``` tags:
        
        	{% maploom_html %}
        
        
        Adding in GeoNode
        -----------------
        To use MapLoom as your GeoNode map client, follow the Project Configuration steps above.  Next, add the MapLoom urls
        to the bottom of the `urls.py` file in GeoNode and append them to the GeoNode url patterns.
        
        ```
        from maploom.geonode.urls import urlpatterns as maploom_urls
        
        urlpatterns += maploom_urls
        ```
        **Note:** When adding `maploom` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting, order matters.  Django will return the first template
        it finds that matches a given name, therefore be sure that the MapLoom application precedes the `geonode.maps`
        application in your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.
