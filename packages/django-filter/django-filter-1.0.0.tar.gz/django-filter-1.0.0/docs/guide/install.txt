============
Installation
============

Django-filter can be installed from PyPI with tools like ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install django-filter

Then add ``'django_filters'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

.. note::

    django-filter provides *some* localization for *some* languages. If you do
    not need these translations (or would rather provide your own), then it is
    unnecessary to add django-filter to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.


Requirements
------------

Django-filter is tested against all supported versions of Python and `Django`__,
as well as the latest versions of Django REST Framework (`DRF`__).
