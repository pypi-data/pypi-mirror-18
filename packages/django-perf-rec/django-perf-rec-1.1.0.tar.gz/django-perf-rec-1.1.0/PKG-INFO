        "Keep detailed records of the performance of your Django code."
        
        **django-perf-rec** is like Django's ``assertNumQueries`` on steroids. It lets
        you track the individual queries and cache operations that occur in your code.
        Use it in your tests like so:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            def test_home(self):
                with django_perf_rec.record():
                    self.client.get('/')
        
        It then stores a YAML file alongside the test file that tracks the queries and
        operations, looking something like:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            MyTests.test_home:
            - cache|get: home_data
            - db: 'SELECT ... FROM myapp_table WHERE (myapp_table.id = #)'
            - db: 'SELECT ... FROM myapp_table WHERE (myapp_table.id = #)'
        
        When the test is run again, the new record will be compared with the one in the
        YAML file. If they are different, an assertion failure will be raised, failing
        the test. Magic!
        
        Just check the YAML file in alongside your test and you have unbreakable
        performance with much better information about any regressions compared to
        ``assertNumQueries``. If you are fine with the changes from a failing test,
        just remove the file and rerun the test to regenerate it.
        
        We also have an `introductory blog
        post <https://tech.yplanapp.com/2016/09/26/introducing-django-perf-rec/>`_ that
        says a little more about why we made it.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Use **pip**:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install django-perf-rec
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Tested with all combinations of:
        
        * Python: 2.7, 3.5
        * Django: 1.8, 1.9, 1.10
        
        API
        ===
        
        ``record(file_name=None, record_name=None, path=None)``
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        Return a context manager that will be used for a single performance test.
        
        ``path`` is the path to a directory or file in which to store the record. If it
        ends with ``'/'``, or is left as ``None``, the filename will be automatically
        determined by looking at the filename the calling code is in and replacing the
        ``.py[c]`` extension with ``.perf.yml``. If it points to a directory that
        doesn't exist, that directory will be created.
        
        ``record_name`` is the name of the record inside the performance file to use.
        If left as ``None``, the code assumes you are inside a Django ``TestCase`` and
        uses magic stack inspection to find that test case, and uses a name based upon
        the test case name + the test method name + an optional counter if you invoke
        ``record()`` multiple times inside the same test method.
        
        ``file_name`` is deprecated in favour of ``path`` and will be removed in a
        future major release. It can be used to point to the filename in which the
        record should be stored, which ``path`` supports too.
        
        Whilst open, the context manager tracks all DB queries on all connections, and
        all cache operations on all defined caches. It names the connection/cache in
        the tracked operation it uses, except from for the ``default`` one.
        
        When the context manager exits, it will use the list of operations it has
        gathered. If the file ``file_name`` doesn't exist, or doesn't contain data for
        the specific ``record_name``, it will be created and saved and the test will
        pass with no assertions. However if the record **does** exist inside the file,
        the collected record will be compared with the original one, and if different,
        an ``AssertionError`` will be raised. This currently uses a plain message, but
        if you're using `pytest <http://pytest.org/>`_ its assertion rewriting will be
        used and make it look pretty.
        
        Example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import django_perf_rec
        
            from app.models import Author
        
            class AuthorPerformanceTests(TestCase):
        
                def test_special_method(self):
                    with django_perf_rec.record():
                        list(Author.objects.special_method())
        
        
        ``TestCaseMixin``
        -----------------
        
        A mixin class to be added to your custom ``TestCase`` subclass so you can use
        **django-perf-rec** across your codebase without needing to import it in each
        individual test file. It adds one method, ``record_performance()``, whose
        signature is the same as ``record()`` above.
        
        Example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # yplan/test.py
            from django.test import TestCase as OrigTestCase
            from django_perf_rec import TestCaseMixin
        
            class TestCase(TestCaseMixin, OrigTestCase):
                pass
        
            # app/tests/models/test_author.py
            from app.models import Author
            from yplan.test import TestCase
        
            class AuthorPerformanceTests(TestCase):
        
                def test_special_method(self):
                    with self.record_performance():
                        list(Author.objects.special_method())
        
        
        
        
        History
        =======

        ------------------
        
        * Fix automatic filenames for tests in ``.pyc`` files.
        * Add the ``path`` argument to ``record`` which allows specifying a relative
          directory or filename to use. This deprecates the ``file_name`` argument,
          which will be removed in a future major release. For more info see the
          README.
        
        1.0.4 (2016-10-23)

        * Work with ``sqlparse`` 0.2.2
        
        1.0.3 (2016-10-07)
        ------------------
        
        * Stopped ``setup.py`` installing ``tests`` module.
        
        1.0.2 (2016-09-23)
        ------------------
        
        * Confirmed Django 1.8 and 1.10 support.
        
        1.0.1 (2016-09-20)
        ------------------
        
        * Fix ``install_requires`` in ``setup.py``.
        
        1.0.0 (2016-09-19)
        ------------------
        
        * Initial version with ``record()`` that can record database queries and cache
          operations and error if they change between test runs.
