# Payload

`Payload` object is being used in both **handlers** and **senders**, it starts with you,
as the BOT, sends the user buttons or quick replies, each of them contains a
payload.

`Payload` is represented in Facebook callback as a simple string, however, in
order for BOT to better handle it, we are going to treat it as a valid json
string.

A payload contains key-value pairs that are dependant to your business logic,
as a result, you will need to write your own payload if you'd like to send
buttons and replies.

`Payload` class provides a `get_instance()` classmethod that simply take a json
string and try to deserialize it back to an instance of the actual subclass.

Here is a quick example, let's say you want to display your products when the
user sends you a simple text "products", what you need to do is

1. Define routing policy

    In your routing policy, specify `SimpleTextBaseHandler` and provide regex
    as "^products$" as a handler for `SIMPLE_TEXT`

2. Custom Sender

    Write a custom sender which extends either `BaseButtonSender` or
    `BaseQuickReplySender` and provide payload that contains your product info,
    something like

    > Make sure you call `super().__init__()`

    ```
    class MyProductPayload(Payload):
        def __init__(self, name, price):
            super().__init__()
            self.name = name
            self.price = price
    ```

    when you're sending, this payload will be serialized into a single string
    and sent along with the template.

    If you subclassed `BaseButtonSender`, you can `add_button()` and provide your
     payload, add multiple buttons using different content in the payload to
     represent multiple products

    Similarly, if you subclassed `BaseQuickReplySender`, you can `add_quick_reply()`
     and provide your payload instance

    The main difference between buttons and quick replies are:
    1. Buttons can only have 3 at a time
    2. Quick Replies can have 10 at a time
    3. When user clicks on Buttons, it generates a **POSTBACK``
    4. When user clicks on quick replies, it generates a **QUICK_REPLY** which is
       a variant of a **SIMPLE_TEXT**

3. Custom handler

    If you want to do something when user clicks on the buttons or quick replies
    (which you most likely would, otherwise why sent buttons, right), you need
    to implement a custom handler which extends either `BaseQuickReplyHandler` or
    `BasePostbackHandler`.

    Both of them defines a method `get_payload()` which will return your an
    instance of `MyProductPayload`, at this point you know which user (PSID)
    clicks on which button (payload) and you can do something like saving to
    database

4. Sender

    Then you can use built-in sender or custom sender again to send something
    back to the user
