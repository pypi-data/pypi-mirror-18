Requirements
------------

Dunshire is a Python library, so it needs a Python interpreter. To
"build" it, you'll need `Setuptools
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_. The only other requirement
is the `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org/>`_ library, available for most Linux
distributions. Dunshire is targeted at python-3.x, but python-2.x will
probably work too.

So, end users require:

* python (tested: 3.4, 3.5)
* setuptools (tested: 20.6.7)
* cvxopt (tested: 1.1.8)

Developers will also want:

* `GNU Make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ for convenience
  and to build the documentation.
* `Pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_ for code warnings.
* `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ to build the documentation.
