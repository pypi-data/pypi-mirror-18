Description: Dunshire is a `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org/>`_-based library for solving
        linear (cone) games. The notion of a symmetric linear (cone) game was
        introduced by Gowda and Ravindran in *On the game-theoretic value of a
        linear transformation relative to a self-dual cone*. I've extended
        their results to asymmetric cones and two interior points in my
        thesis, which does not exist yet.
        
        The main idea can be gleaned from Gowda and Ravindran, however.
        Additional details and our problem formulation can be found in the
        full Dunshire documentation. The state-of-the-art is that only
        symmetric games can be solved efficiently, and thus the linear games
        supported by Dunshire are a compromise between the two: the cones are
        symmetric, but the players get to choose two interior points.
        
        Only the nonnegative orthant and the ice-cream cone are supported at
        the moment. The symmetric positive-semidefinite cone is coming soon.
