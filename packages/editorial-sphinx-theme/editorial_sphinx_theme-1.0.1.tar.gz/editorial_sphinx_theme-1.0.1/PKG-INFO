        Installation
        ============
        
        Via package
        -----------
        
        Download the package or add it to your requirements.txt file:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install editorial_sphinx_theme
        
        In your ``conf.py`` file:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import editorial_sphinx_theme
        
            html_theme = "editorial_sphinx_theme"
        
            html_theme_path = [editorial_sphinx_theme.get_html_theme_path()]
        
        
        Via git or download
        -------------------
        
        You can install it directly from the Git repository, keep in mind that this will download the last changes made that
        may not be stable and lead to failures. For sites in production try to use the version available in PyPi.
        
        There are two main branches 'master' with stable code and 'develop' with the latest modifications made.
        
        Symlink or subtree the editorial_sphinx_theme/editorial_sphinx_theme repository into your documentation at 
        docs/_themes/editorial_sphinx_theme then add the following two settings to your Sphinx conf.py file:
        
        Branch **master**

        Branch **develop**
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install -e git+https://gitlab.com/opb/editorial-sphinx-theme.git@develop#egg=editorial_sphinx_theme
        
        .. code:: python
        
            html_theme = "editorial_sphinx_theme"
            html_theme_path = ["_themes", ]

            This indicates the Google Analytics ID used by this service, if you do not pass any value the javascript script
            will not load on the page. The value must have the format "UA-XXXXX-Y".

        Social links [Optional]
        -----------------------
        
        Add in the header a series of links to different social networks, they don't need individual explanation. It is enough
        to indicate the url of the social network to activate it
        
        Available: github, bitbucket, gitlab, other_git, twitter, facebook
        
        
        Fork Me Ribbon [Optional]

        You can enable the use of a ribbon in a corner of the page, with the legend "Fork me on <repo_name>" and the
        destination url is the repository specified in the 'repo_url'
        
        The options that you can use are as follows:
        
        **forkme_ribbon**

            Where shown, take the following locations: left-top, right-top, left-bottom, right-bottom
        
            
        **forkme_fixed**
        
            If you pass 'True' to this option, the ribbon will be shown with the CSS property fixed, and as we scroll on the
            page will continue showing in the same corner.
