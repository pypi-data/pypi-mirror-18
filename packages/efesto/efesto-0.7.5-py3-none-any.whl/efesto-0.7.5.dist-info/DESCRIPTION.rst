Efesto

|Pypi| |Build Status| |Coverage| |Code Climate|

Efesto is a RESTful (micro)server that can be used for building an API in
minutes. It takes care of authentication, permissions and kickstarts you by
providing a simple way to build a data structure and the means to expose it.

Efesto follows the UNIX principle of doing one thing and well, leaving you the
freedom of choice about other components (e.g. caching, rate-limiting,
load balancer).

When do I use this?
-------------------
* You need a full-fledged ReST API
* You are fine using Siren as hypermedia specification
* You need authentication and permissions but want the work already done
* You are fine with using PostgreSQL
* You want to be able to create models without writing code (Python or SQL)
* You need to easily import and export the models you created
* You have Python3.4+ on your production server :)


Installing
----------
You will need to install and configure PostgreSQL, and a server like uwsgi or
gunicorn::

    pip3 install efesto

Configure Efesto, editing the configuration file. At the very minimum you
will need to provide the database details::

    vim efesto.cfg

Use efesto-quickstart to have tables and admin created::

    efesto-quickstart

Done! Now you can run your server and launch Efesto::

    gunicorn efesto.App:app


The first request
-----------------
Efesto only allows authenticated users to make requests, so first authenticate
yourself using the /auth endpoint. You will receive an access token that
should be sent in the Auth header::


    POST http://myhost.com/auth
    username=myuser&password=mypasswd

    {'token':'someverylongtoken'}


Now that you have a token, you can make requests! For example, to get a list
of users::

    GET http://myhost.com/users
    Authorization: Basic anystring:someverylongtoken

    # [ ... list of users ]
