This is a directory for miscellany. Scripts that should be accessible, but relatively hidden.
Things that have no real and active purpose, but might be useful enough to keep around in case such a purpose arises.

It is intentional that this directory does NOT contain `__init__.py`. It is not intended to be accessible as a python module.

If there is code here, users run it at their peril. It is probably untested, written against an older version of estnltk and might contain monsters.
