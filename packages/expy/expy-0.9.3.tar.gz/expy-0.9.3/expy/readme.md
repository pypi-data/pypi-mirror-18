# Overview
Expy is an easy-but-powerful psychology experiment builder. It's designed for psycholinguistic experiment, but also be suitable for any other visual or auditory experiments.

## Installation instructions

The simplest way to install Expy is through the Python Package Index (PyPI). This will ensure that all required dependencies are fulfilled. This can be achieved by executing the following command:

```
pip install expy
```
or:
```
sudo pip install expy
```

###*Required Dependencies:*
- numpy

- pandas

- scipy

- pygame

- pyaudio

- wave

- pyserial

## Simple example

```python
# coding:utf-8
from expy import * # Import the needed functions
start() # Initiate the experiment environment

# An RSPV demo
for w in 'ABCDE12345':
    drawText(w) # Draw something on the canvas(not the screen)
    show(200) # Show the content of current canvas on the screen, and keep for 200ms
```

## Cookbook
### *Experiment Initiation*
```python
from expy import * # Import the needed functions
start() # Initiate the experiment environment
```

### *Experiment Structure*
A standard experiment contains 3 levels:
- Run(Session)
- Block
- Trial
  So we suggest that your code should have hierarchical structure, as the example belowï¼š
```python
from expy import *
start()

def trial(stim):
    draw(stim)
    show(1000)

def block(trialList):
    for stim in trialList:
        trial(stim)

def run():
    for trialList in blockList:
        block(trialList)

run()
```
### *Visual Experiment*
```python
from expy import * # Import the needed functions
start() # Initiate the experiment environment

tip('In this example, you need to respond to the words "left" with the F key , and respond to the words "right" with the J key. ') # Display something until pressing 'SPACE' or 'ENTER'

def trial(word,pos):
    drawText(word,x=pos) # Draw text on the canvas
    show() # Display current canvas

    key = waitForEvent({K_f:'Left',K_j:'Right'}) # Waiting for pressing 'F' or 'J'
    if key==word:
        alertAndGo('Correct!',1000) # Display something in 1s
    else:
        alertAndGo('Wrong!',1000)

    show(500) # Pause (show a screen during 500ms)

alertAndGo('The experiment will start after 3s.') # Display something in 3s(default)

stimuli = [('Left',-0.5),
            ('Right',0.5),
            ('Right',-0.5),
            ('Left',0.5),
            ('Left',-0.5),
            ('Right',-0.5)]
for word,pos in stimuli:
    trial(word,pos) # Call the trial function with different parameters

alertAndQuit('Done!') # Display something in 3s(default), and quit the program
```

### *Auditory Experiment*
```python
from expy import * # Import the needed functions
start() # Initiate the experiment environment

tip('In this example, you need to press key to select the word you heard.') # Display something until pressing 'SPACE' or 'ENTER'

def trial(stim):
    sound = loadSound('data/'+stim+'.WAV') # Load the wav file
    playSound(sound) # Play the wav file

    textSlide('Please press F for "ba", or press J for "da"')
    key = waitForEvent({K_f:'ba',K_j:'da'}) # Waiting for pressing 'F' or 'J'

    if key==stim:
        alertAndGo('Correct!',1000) # Display something in 1s
    else:
        alertAndGo('Wrong!',1000)

    show(500) # Pause (show a screen during 500ms)

alertAndGo('The experiment will start after 3s.') # Display something in 3s(default)
for stim in ['ba','da','da','ba']:
    trial(stim) # Call the trial function with different parameters

alertAndQuit('Done!') # Display something in 3s(default), and quit the program
```
