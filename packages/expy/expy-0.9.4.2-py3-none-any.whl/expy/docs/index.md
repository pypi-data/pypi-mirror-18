Expy is an easy-but-powerful psychology experiment framework. It's aimed at building an experiment without strugglling against the manual work of stimuli or the coding logic, by using a various of module functions.
Expy is designed for psycholinguistic experiment, but also be suitable for any other experiments.

**Advantange**:

- Various of stimuli module (not need to prepare massive of stimuli pictures).
- Various of procedure-controlling module (instruction, tip, rest, etc.)
- Convenient to read stimuli from file and record response to file.
- Getting participant's response data (keyboard, mouse, joystick) by one function.
- Sending trigger easily.
- You can pause or quit the program at anytime.

**Drawback**:

- Drawing complex shape (like grating) as stimuli (but you could draw them as loaded pictures).
- Video playing.
