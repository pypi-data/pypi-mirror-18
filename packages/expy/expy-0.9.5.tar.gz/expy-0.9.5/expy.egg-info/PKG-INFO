Description: # Overview
        
        Expy is an easy-but-powerful psychology experiment framework. It's aimed at building an experiment without strugglling against the manual work of stimuli or the coding logic, by using a various of module functions.
        Expy is designed for psycholinguistic experiment, but also be suitable for any other experiments.
        
        **Advantange**:
        
        - Various of stimuli module (not need to prepare massive of stimuli pictures).
        - Various of procedure-controlling module (instruction, tip, rest, etc.)
        - Convenient to read stimuli from file and record response to file.
        - Getting participant's response data (keyboard, mouse, joystick) by one function.
        - Sending trigger easily.
        - You can pause or quit the program at anytime.
        
        **Drawback**:
        
        - Drawing complex shape (like grating) as stimuli (but you could draw them as loaded pictures).
        - Video playing.

        # Simple example (An RSPV demo)
        
        ```python
        # coding:utf-8
        from expy import * # Import the needed functions
        start() # Initiate the experiment environment
        
        for w in 'ABCDE12345':
            drawText(w) # Draw something on the canvas(not the screen)
            show(200) # Display current canvas on the screen, and keep for 200ms
