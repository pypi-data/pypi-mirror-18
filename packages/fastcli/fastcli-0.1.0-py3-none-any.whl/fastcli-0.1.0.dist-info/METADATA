Python3 CLI script for fast.com

-  Free software: MIT
-  Documentation: https://fastcli.readthedocs.org

Features
--------

Shows approximate download speed by way of Fast.com.

Introduction
------------

Fast.com is a newish Netflix download speed test. It bases its results
on download speed of actual Netflix video content, which makes it much
harder for ISPs to embellish their results (without also speeding up all
of Netflix, which may account for as much as 30% of all internet
traffic).

It doesn't test upload speed or ping, so ``fastcli`` doesn't either.

Dependencies
------------

-  Python >= 3.5
-  See ``requirements.txt``

Quickstart
----------

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install fastcli
    fastcli

Development Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Clone the repo:
   ``git clone https://github.com/n8henrie/fastcli && cd    fastcli``
2. Install into a virtualenv:

.. code:: bash

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install .[dev]

Configuration
-------------

-  Optionally accepts a ``--runtime`` argument which may affect accuracy
   by changing to values shorter or longer than the default of 10
   (seconds).

Acknowledgements
----------------

Troubleshooting / FAQ
