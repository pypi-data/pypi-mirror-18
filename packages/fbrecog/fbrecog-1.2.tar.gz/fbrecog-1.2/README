### fbrecog is a python wrapper that uses Facebook’s face recognition to
recognize faces in pictures. ## How-To:

2. Now simply import the recognize method from fbrecog module
   ``from fbrecog import recognize``
3. The recognize method takes 4 input args and returns an array of
   recognitions.
4. To get the access token simply go to
   https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer and get a user access
   token with *user\_photos*, *publish\_actions* and *user\_posts*
   permissions.
5. Get your Facebook cookie and fb\_dtsg token as follows:

-  Go to your Facebook profile.

-  Open chrome dev tools by ``Right Click > Inspect``

-  Upload any picture. As it gets uploaded monitor the Network tab for
   ‘dpr?’ endpoint.

-  Click on it. Scroll down to *Request Header*. Copy the entire cookie
   string.

-  Scroll further down to *Form Data*. Copy the value of fb\_dtsg
   parameter.

6. Call the recognize method with the following parameters.

.. code:: python


    from fbrecog import recognize
    path = '1.jpg' #Insert your image file path here
    access_token = '#######' #Insert your access token obtained from Graph API explorer here
    cookie = '###' #Insert your cookie string here
    fb_dtsg = '###' #Insert the fb_dtsg parameter obtained from Form Data here.
    print(recognize(path,access_token,cookie,fb_dtsg))
