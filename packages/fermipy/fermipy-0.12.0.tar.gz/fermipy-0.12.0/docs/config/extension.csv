``fix_background``	False	Fix any background parameters that are currently free in the model when performing the likelihood scan over extension.
``psf_scale_fn``	None	Tuple of vectors (logE,f) defining an energy-dependent PSF scaling function that will be applied when building spatial models for the source of interest.  The tuple (logE,f) defines the fractional corrections f at the sequence of energies logE = log10(E/MeV) where f=0 means no correction.  The correction function f(E) is evaluated by linearly interpolating the fractional correction factors f in log(E).  The corrected PSF is given by P'(x;E) = P(x/(1+f(E));E) where x is the angular separation.
``save_model_map``	False	Save model counts cubes for the best-fit model of extension.
``spatial_model``	RadialGaussian	Spatial model use for extension test.
``sqrt_ts_threshold``	None	Threshold on sqrt(TS_ext) that will be applied when ``update`` is True.  If None then nothreshold is applied.
``update``	False	Update the source model with the best-fit spatial extension.
``width``	None	Parameter vector for scan over spatial extent.  If none then the parameter vector will be set from ``width_min``, ``width_max``, and ``width_nstep``.
``width_max``	1.0	Maximum value in degrees for the likelihood scan over spatial extent.
``width_min``	0.01	Minimum value in degrees for the likelihood scan over spatial extent.
``width_nstep``	21	Number of steps for the spatial likelihood scan.
