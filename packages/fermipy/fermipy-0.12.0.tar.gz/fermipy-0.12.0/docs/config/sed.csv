``bin_index``	2.0	Spectral index that will be use when fitting the energy distribution within an energy bin.
``cov_scale``	3.0	Scale factor that sets the strength of the prior on nuisance parameters when ``fix_background`` is True.  Setting this to None disables the prior.
``fix_background``	True	Fix background normalization parameters when fitting the source flux in each energy bin.  If True background normalizations will be profiled with a prior on their value with strength set by ``cov_scale``.
``ul_confidence``	0.95	Confidence level for upper limit calculation.
``use_local_index``	False	Use a power-law approximation to the shape of the global spectrum in each bin.  If this is false then a constant index set to `bin_index` will be used.
