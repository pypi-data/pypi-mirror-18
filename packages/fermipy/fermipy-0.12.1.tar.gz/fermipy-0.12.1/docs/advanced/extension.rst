Extension Fitting
=================

The :py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.extension` method executes
a source extension analysis for a given source by computing a
likelihood ratio test with respect to the no-extension (point-source)
hypothesis and a best-fit model for extension.  The best-fit extension
is evaluated by a likelihood profile scan over the source width.
Currently this method supports two models for extension: a 2D Gaussian
(*RadialGaussian*) or a 2D disk (*RadialDisk*).

At runtime the default settings for the extension analysis can be
overriden by passing one or more *kwargs* when executing
:py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.extension`:

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Run extension fit of sourceA with default settings
   >>> gta.extension('sourceA')

   # Override default spatial model
   >>> gta.extension('sourceA',spatial_model='RadialDisk')

By default the extension method will profile over any background
parameters that were free when the method was executed.  One can fix
all background parameters by setting ``fix_background=True``:

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Free a nearby source that maybe be partially degenerate with the
   # source of interest
   gta.free_norm('sourceB')

   # Normalization of SourceB will be refit when testing the extension
   # of sourceA
   gta.extension('sourceA')

   # Fix all background parameters when testing the extension
   # of sourceA
   gta.extension('sourceA',fix_background=True)

The results of the extension analysis are written to a dictionary
which is the return value of the extension method.  This dictionary
is also written to the *extension* dictionary of the corresponding
source and will also be saved in the output file generated by
:py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.write_roi`.
   
.. code-block:: python
   
   ext = gta.extension('sourceA')

   ext = gta.roi['sourceA']
   
The contents of the output dictionary are described in the following table:

Configuration
-------------

The default configuration of the method is controlled with the
:ref:`config_extension` section of the configuration file.  The default
configuration can be overriden by passing the option as a *kwargs*
argument to the method.
