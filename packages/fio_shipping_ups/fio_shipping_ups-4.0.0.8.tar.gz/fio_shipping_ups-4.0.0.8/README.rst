The module was renamed from `ups` to `shipping_ups` to be consistent in naming
with all the other shipping modules. This migration could not be automated with
the migration API. 

`A migration script <https://gist.github.com/sharoonthomas/d173234e625d5a8ce90a>`_
is available and the usage instructions can be seen on the comments.
