===================================
Build Docker images using SaltStack
===================================

This is a Python library and set of tools that lets you build `Docker <http://docker.com>`_ images using 
`SaltStack <http://saltstack.com/>`_ instead of (or in addition to) using Dockerfiles.

============================
Why would I want to do that?
============================

* Because you want to install the same software stack on developer workstations and don't want to 
  maintain two separate ways of installing a complex stack of software.
* Because you are installing a complex stack of software and have outgrown Docker's simple installation system.

============
Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install flyingcloud
