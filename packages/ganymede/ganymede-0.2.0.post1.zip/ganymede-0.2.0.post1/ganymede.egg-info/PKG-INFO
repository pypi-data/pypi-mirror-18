Description: Have you also wondered where the fourth Galilean moon in
        `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`__'s logo has gone? Well, it is told that
        after many centuries of Ganymede's absence from Mount Olympus, Zeus felt
        a deep and painful longing. So he sent out his eagle again to find
        Ganymede and bring him back. But Ganymede always wanted to be more than
        just a servant for the pleasure of the gods. He turned to Jupyter with
        an offer. If Jupyter grant him shelter in his giant atmosphere then
        Ganymede would build him a new temple. A temple to attract a whole new
        generation of worshippers. Jupyter accepted...
        
        Currently, the temple can only be visited from Python. There will soon
        be other ways to get there. Just use `pip <http://pip-installer.org>`__
        to automatically install the latest
        `gate <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ganymede>`__ with its dependencies
        from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org>`__:
        
        ::
        
            pip install ganymede
        
        It can also be visited in development mode, directly from Ganymede's
        repository. The additional development dependencies are automatically
        resolved by running the following commands in the repository's root
        directory:
        
        ::
        
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
            pip install -e .
        
        You also need an installed `CoffeeScript <http://coffeescript.org>`__
        compiler for development mode.
        
        Then open an IPython notebook in Jupyter's web interface and:

        Some of Jupyter's control elements are hidden, like the cell format and
        cell toolbar select boxes. They still need to find their new place,
        along with these additional features coming soon:
        
        -  Menu button in slim mode tool bar
        -  Redocking of cell outputs to the console
        -  Visual indicators for cell inputs on hovering their undocked outputs
           and vice versa and auto console scrolling to input
        -  Switchable virtual background screens for undocked outputs with
           selection bar in menu area
        -  A %terminal magic to embed Jupyter's remote terminals in notebooks
        -  Tabbed multi-notebook console and ability to mix undocked cell
           outputs from different notebooks and kernels
