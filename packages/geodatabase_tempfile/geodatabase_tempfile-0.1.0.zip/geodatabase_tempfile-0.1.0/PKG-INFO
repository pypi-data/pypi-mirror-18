Description: Implements a temporary geodatabase management system that wraps around arcpy.CreateScratchName
        	  and arcpy.CreateUniqueName to manage the workspace that Unique/Scratch names are placed into, allowing you to focus
        	  on just getting a name and not having to check where it's stored or whether your scratch database exists.
        	  
Platform: UNKNOWN
