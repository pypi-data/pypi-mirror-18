Hi Sherry,

I'm asking a favor of you to beta test the Subaru FITS viewer "ginga" on your mac.  I include a link to the google drive page where you can download a DMG file (current version Ginga-2.0.201405200035237.dmg) to install it.  There is also a README there which I highly recommend to read.  Any feedback from an astronomer's point of view would be very valuable.  I am giving another paper on the viewer at an astronomical software conference in July, so I am trying to expand the user's circle to get more feedback.

The download will take a little while (it's nearly 1GB!) so I recommend to download on a decent internet connection.  Double click the DMG file to mount it, then browse the "Ginga" drive from the Mac finder (left hand pane).  From the drive contents drag the ginga icon to your application folder.  Double-click ginga to open it.  It may take a long time to start the first launch, but should launch much faster on subsequent starts. 

If you are using it on a macbook, I highly recommend installing the trackpad bindings (there is a note about this in the README).

I am happy to answer any questions you have about how to use the viewer.  Of course any Subaru SA or operator is also familiar and can probably answer most questions. Josh W. is also a beta tester on the Mac version and also a good resource.  If you enjoy using it, let me know and I can give you some additional plugins that can be used with SPCAM and HSC data.

Thanks and Regards,
~Eric

Hi Robert,

Would you be willing to be a beta tester for the Subaru FITS viewer "ginga" on your mac?  I include a link to the google drive page where you can download a DMG file (current version Ginga-2.0.201405200035237.dmg).  This is a fully self-contained version packaged as a standard Mac application, and won't install any modules or interfere with your other python modules or environment settings.  There is also a README there which I highly recommend to read.  I am giving another paper on the viewer at SciPy in July, so I am trying to expand the user's circle to get more feedback.

The download will take a little while (it's nearly 1GB!) so I recommend to download on a decent internet connection.  Double click the DMG file to mount it, then browse the "Ginga" drive from the Mac finder (left hand pane).  From the drive contents drag the ginga icon to your application folder.
