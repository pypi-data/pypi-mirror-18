If you would like to help improve Ginga, there are several ways you can
help.  

---------------------
Software improvements
---------------------

Plugins
-------
With regard to the reference viewer, plugins are a logical place to
contribute, since they are modular in design, have a known API and,
especially in the case of local plugins, do not affect the stability of
anything outside of their own use.

Many of the plugins (especially the local plugins) are rough and
unpolished, prepared as a kind of proof of concept.  Most could stand
some usability enhancements at the least, and maybe a complete overhaul.

Have a quick read over the sections :ref:`sec-writing-plugins`, and skim
the code for the example plugin.  Then browse the plugins in the code in
``.../ginga/misc/plugins``.
