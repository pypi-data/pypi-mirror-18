About Ginga
-----------

Ginga is a viewer for astronomical data FITS (Flexible Image Transport
System) files. 

The Ginga viewer centers around a new FITS display widget which supports
zooming and panning, color and intensity mapping, a choice of several
automatic cut levels algorithms and canvases for plotting scalable
geometric forms. In addition to this widget, the fits viewer provides a
flexible plugin framework for extending the viewer with many different
features. A fairly complete set of "standard" plugins are provided for
features that we expect from a modern viewer: panning and zooming
windows, star catalog access, cuts, star pick/fwhm, thumbnails, etc.

The basic Ginga display widget supports the Qt, Gtk and Tk widget sets,
while the full reference viewer supports Qt and Gtk.

   FAQ

Some training videos are available in the 
`downloads <https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga/downloads>`_ section at
github.

Bug reports?
------------

Please file an issue with the `issue tracker
<https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga/issues>`_
on github.

Ginga has a logging facility, and it would be most helpful if you can
invoke Ginga with the logging options to capture any logged errors::

    $ ginga --loglevel=20 --log=ginga.log

If the difficulty is with non-display or non-working WCS for a
particular image file please be ready to supply the file for our aid in
debugging. 

Developers
----------

In the source code `scripts` directory, see example{1,2}_gtk.py (Gtk),
example{1,2}_qt.py (Qt) or example{1,2}_tk.py (Tk).
There is more information for developers in the manual.  

See the Module Index at the bottom of this document.

Etymology
---------

"Ginga" is the romanized spelling of the Japanese word "銀河" (hiragana:
ぎんが), meaning "galaxy" (in general) and, more familiarly, the Milky
Way. This viewer was written by software engineers at 
`Subaru Telescope <http://subarutelescope.org/>`_,
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan--thus the connection. 

Pronunciation
-------------

Ginga the viewer may be pronounced "ging-ga" (proper japanese) or
"jing-ga" (perhaps easier for western tongues). The latter pronunciation
has meaning in the Brazilian dance/martial art capoeira: a fundamental
rocking or back and forth swinging motion.  Pronounciation as "jin-ja"
is considered poor form.
