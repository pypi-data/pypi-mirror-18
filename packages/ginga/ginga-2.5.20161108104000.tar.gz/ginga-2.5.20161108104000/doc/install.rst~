Detailed Installation Instructions for Ginga
============================================

Dependences
-----------
Ginga is written entirely in Python, and only uses supporting Python
packages.  There is nothing to compile, unless you need to compile one
of the supporting packages.

On recent Linux, Mac and Windows versions, all of the packages are
available in binary (installable) form; it should not be necessary to
compile anything.  But as always, YMMV.

You will need:

* python (v. 2.7 or higher)
* python-numpy

Highly recommended, because some features will not work without them:

* python-scipy
* python-astropy

Also, depending on which GUI toolkit you prefer, you will need either:

* python-gtk
* python-cairo

OR

* python-qt4

OR

* python-pyside (qt4 alternative)

(Mac and Windows platforms should probably install the Qt version,
unless you are adventurous.  Either one works fine on Linux.)

Certain plugins (or features of those plugins) will not work without the
following packages:

* python-matplotlib (Pick, Cuts, Histogram)
* python-webkit (WBrowser (online help))
