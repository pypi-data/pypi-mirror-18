Optimizing Ginga's Performance
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are several ways to optimize the performance of certain aspects of
Ginga's operation.

OpenCL Acceleration
-------------------
Ginga includes support for OpenCL accelerated array operations for some
operations (e.g. rotation).  *This support is not enabled by default*.

To enable OpenCL support, install the `pyopencl` module::

    $ pip install pyopencl

    
`pyopencl` may prompt you if it can't figure out which device is the
obvious choice to use as for hardware acceleration:: 

    NVIDIA: no NVIDIA devices found
    Choose platform:
    [0] <pyopencl.Platform 'Intel(R) OpenCL' at 0x2d95fd0>
    [1] <pyopencl.Platform 'Clover' at 0x7f13f3ffcac0>
    Choice [0]:
    Set the environment variable PYOPENCL_CTX='' to avoid being asked again.
    /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pyopencl/__init__.py:63: CompilerWarning: Non-empty compiler output encountered. Set the environment variable PYOPENCL_COMPILER_OUTPUT=1 to see more.
    
If so, you can set the `PYOPENCL_CTX` variable as shown to prevent being
prompted in the future.
