Developing with Ginga
+++++++++++++++++++++

* :ref:`modindex`

Developers interested in using Ginga in their project will probably
follow one of two logical development paths: 

- using only the Ginga rendering class in a program of their own design, or
- starting with the full-featured reference viewer that comes with Ginga
  and customizing it for some special purpose, typically by modifying
  one of the plugins or writing a new plugin.

The first approach is probably best for when the developer has a custom
application in mind, needs a minimal but powerful viewer or wants to
develop an entirely new full-featured viewer.  The second approach is
probably best for end users or developers that are mostly satisfied with
the reference viewer as a general purpose tool and want to add some specific
enhancements or functionality.  Because the reference viewer is based on
a flexible plugin architecture this is fairly easy to do.  We examine
both approaches in this chapter.

===============================================
Using the basic rendering class in new programs
===============================================

First, let's take a look at how to use the "bare" Ginga rending class
by itself.  Ginga basically follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
design pattern, that is described in more detail in
the :ref:`chapter on internals <ch-programming-internals>`.
The "view" classes are rooted in the base class ``ImageView``.
Ginga supports backends for different widget sets through various
subclasses of this class.   

Typically, a developer picks a GUI toolkit that has a supported backend
(Gtk, Qt, Tk, Matplotlib) and writes a GUI program using that widget set
with the typical Python toolkit bindings and API.  Where they want a 
image view pane they instantiate the appropriate subclass of 
``ImageView``, and using the  ``get_widget()`` call extract the native
widget and insert it into the GUI layout.  A reference should be kept to
the view object.

Ginga does not create any additional GUI components beyond the image
pane itself, however it does provide a standard set of keyboard and
mouse bindings on the widget that can be enabled, disabled or changed.
The user interface bindings are configurable via a pluggable
``Bindings`` class which constitutes the "controller" part of the MVC
design.  There are a plethora of callbacks that can be registered,
allowing the user to create their own custom user interface for
manipulating the view.   

.. _fig1:

   :scale: 100%
   :figclass: h

   A simple, "bare bones" FITS viewer written in Qt.  

Listing 1 shows a code listing for a simple graphical FITS
viewer built using the subclass ``ImageViewZoom`` from the module
``ginga.qtw`` (screenshot in Figure :ref:`fig1`) written in around 100
or so lines of Python.  It creates a window containing an image view and
two buttons.  This example, included with the Ginga source (look in the
``examples`` directory), will open FITS files dragged and dropped on the 
image window or via a dialog popped up when clicking the "Open File"
button.

	    image.load_file(filepath)
	    self.fitsimage.set_image(image)
	    self.setWindowTitle(filepath)

	def open_file(self):
	    res = QtGui.QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(self, "Open FITS file",
						    ".", "FITS files (*.fits)")
	    if isinstance(res, tuple):
		fileName = res[0].encode('ascii')
	    else:
		fileName = str(res)
	    self.load_file(fileName)

	def drop_file(self, fitsimage, paths):
	    fileName = paths[0]
	    self.load_file(fileName)


    def main(options, args):

	app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)

	logger = logging.getLogger("example1")
	logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
	fmt = logging.Formatter(STD_FORMAT)
	stderrHdlr = logging.StreamHandler()
	stderrHdlr.setFormatter(fmt)
	logger.addHandler(stderrHdlr)

	w = FitsViewer(logger)
	w.resize(524, 540)
	w.show()
	app.setActiveWindow(w)
	w.raise_()
	w.activateWindow()

	if len(args) > 0:
	    w.load_file(args[0])

	app.exec_()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
	main(None, sys.argv[1:])
    
Looking at the constructor for this particular viewer, you can see where
we create a ``ImageViewZoom`` object.  On this object we enable automatic
cut levels (using the 'zscale' algorithm), configure it to auto zoom the
image to fit the window and set a callback function for files dropped on
the window.  We extract the user-interface bindings with
``get_bindings()``, and on this object enable standard user interactive
controls for panning, zooming, cut levels, simple transformations (flip
x/y and swap axes), rotation and color map warping.
We then extract the platform-specific widget (Qt-based, in this case) using
``get_widget()`` and pack it into a Qt container along with a couple of
buttons to complete the viewer. 

Scanning down the code a bit, we can see that whether by dragging and
dropping or via the click to open, we ultimately call the load_file()
method to get the data into the viewer.  As shown, load_file creates 
an AstroImage object (the "model" part of our MVC design).  It then
passes this object to the viewer via the set_image() method.  
AstroImage objects have methods for ingesting data via a file path, an
``Astropy``/``pyfits`` HDU or a bare ``Numpy`` data array. 

Many of these sorts of examples are contained in the ``examples``
directory in the source distribution.  Look for files with names
matching example*_*.py

Graphics plotting with Ginga
----------------------------

.. _fig2:
.. figure:: figures/example2_screenshot.png
   :scale: 100%
   :figclass: h

   An example of a ``ImageViewCanvas`` widget with graphical overlay. 

For each supported widget set there is a subclass of ImageViewZoom called
``ImageViewCanvas`` (an example is shown in Figure :ref:`fig2`).
This class adds scalable object plotting on top of the image view plane.
A variety of simple graphical shapes are available,
including lines, circles, rectangles, points, polygons, text, rulers,
compasses, etc.  Plotted objects scale, transform and rotate seamlessly
with the image. 

See the scripts prefaced with "example2" (under the "examples"
directory) in the package source for details.  

Rendering into Matplotlib Figures
---------------------------------

Ginga can also render directly into a Matplotlib Figure, which opens up
interesting possibilities for overplotting beyond the limited
capabilities of the ``ImageViewCanvas`` class.  In short,
this allows you to have all the interactive UI goodness of a Ginga widget
in a matplotlib figure.  You can interactively flip, rotate, pan, zoom,
set cut levels and color map warp a FITS image.  Furthermore, you can plot
using matplotlib plotting on top of the image and the plots will follow all
the transformations.  The interactive performance is not quite as speedy
as with the other toolkit backends, but quite usable.

Look at the examples in `examples/matplotlib`, especially `example4_mpl.py`.

.. _sec-writing-plugins:

========================================
Writing plugins for the reference viewer
========================================

We now turn our attention to the other approach to developing with
Ginga: modifying the reference viewer.
The philosophy behind the design of the reference viewer distributed
with the Ginga is that it is simply a flexible layout shell for
instantiating instances of the viewing widget described in the earlier
section.  All of the other important pieces of a modern FITS viewer--a
panning widget, information panels, zoom widget, analysis panes--are
implemented as plugins: encapsulated modules that interface with the
viewing shell using a standardized API.  This makes it easy to customize
and to add, change or remove functionality in a very modular, flexible way.

The Ginga viewer divides the application window GUI into containers that
hold either viewing widgets or plugins.  The view widgets are called
"channels" in the viewer nomenclature, and are a means of organizing
images in the viewer, functioning much like "frames" in other viewers.
A channel has a name and maintains its own history of images that have
cycled through it.  The user can create new channels as needed.  For
example, they might use different channels for different kinds of
images: camera vs. spectrograph, or channels organized by CCD, or by
target, or raw data vs. quick look, etc.  In the default layout, shown
in :ref:`fig2` the channel tabs are in the large middle pane, while the
plugins occupy the left and right panes.  Other layouts are possible, by
simply changing a table used in the startup script.

Ginga distinguishes between two types of plugin: *global* and *local*.  
Global plugins are used where the functionality is generally enabled
during the entire session with the viewer and where the plugin is active
no matter which channel is currenly under interaction with the user.
Examples of global plugins include a panning view (a small, bird's-eye
view of the image that shows a panning rectangle and allows graphical
positioning of the pan region), a zoomed view (that shows an enlarged
cutout of the area currently under the cursor), informational displays
about world coordinates, FITS headers, thumbnails, etc.  Figure
:ref:`fig4` shows an example of two global plugins occupying a notebook tab.

.. _fig4:
.. figure:: figures/global_plugin1.png
   :scale: 100%
   :figclass: h

   Two global plugins: ``Pan`` (top) and ``Info`` (bottom), shown sharing a tab.

Local plugins are used for modal operations with images in specific
channels.  For example, the Pick plugin is used to perform stellar
evaluation of objects, finding the center of the object and giving
informational readings of the exact celestial coordinates, image
quality, etc.  The Pick plugin is only visible while the user has it
open, and does not capture the mouse actions unless the channel it is
operating on is selected.  Thus one can have two different Pick
operations going on concurrently on two different channels, for example,
or a Pick operation in a camera channel, and a Cuts (line cuts)
operation on a spectrograph channel. 
Figure :ref:`fig5` shows an example of the Pick local plugin occupying a
notebook tab. 

.. _fig5:
.. figure:: figures/local_plugin1.png
   :scale: 100%
   :figclass: thb

   The ``Pick`` local plugin, shown occupying a tab.

.. _sec-writing-local-plugins:

Anatomy of a Local Ginga Plugin
-------------------------------

Let's take a look at a local plugin to understand the API for
interfacing to the Ginga shell.  In Listing 2, we show a stub for a
local plugin.  

.. code-block:: python

    from ginga import GingaPlugin

    class MyPlugin(GingaPlugin.LocalPlugin):

	def __init__(self, fv, fitsimage):
	    super(MyPlugin, self).__init__(fv, fitsimage)

	def build_gui(self, container):
	    pass

	def start(self):
	    pass

	def stop(self):
            pass

	def pause(self):
	    pass

	def resume(self):
	    pass

	def redo(self):
	    pass

	def __str__(self):
	    return 'myplugin'


A little more fleshed out example: MyLocalPlugin
------------------------------------------------

This is a skeleton for a local plugin.  It is also good example of
something that actually runs and can be copied as a template for a local
plugin.  This plugin is distributed with the Ginga package and can be
loaded and invoked from a terminal:

    $ ginga --plugins=MyLocalPlugin --loglevel=20 --log=/tmp/ginga.log

The plugin will be accessible via the "Operation" button in the Plugin
Manager bar.

.. code-block:: python

    from ginga import GingaPlugin
    from ginga.misc import Widgets

    # import any other modules you want here--it's a python world!

    class MyLocalPlugin(GingaPlugin.LocalPlugin):

        def __init__(self, fv, fitsimage):
            """
            This method is called when the plugin is loaded for the  first
            time.  ``fv`` is a reference to the Ginga (reference viewer) shell
            and ``fitsimage`` is a reference to the specific ImageViewCanvas
            object associated with the channel on which the plugin is being
            invoked.
            You need to call the superclass initializer and then do any local
            initialization.

The instance variables "fv" and "fitsimage" will be assigned by the
superclass initializer to self.fv and self.fitsimage--these are the
reference viewer "shell" and the ginga display object respectively.
To interact with the viewer you will be calling methods on one or both
of these objects. 

The best way to get a feel for these APIs is to look at the source of
one of the many plugins distributed with Ginga.  Most of them are not
very long or complex.  Also, a plugin can include any Python
packages or modules that it wants and programming one is essentially
similar to writing any other Python program.

Launching and Debugging Your Plugin
-----------------------------------
The easiest way to start out is to create a plugins directory under your
ginga configuration area.  In a terminal:

    $ mkdir $HOME/.ginga/plugins

Put your plugin in there (a good one to start with is to modify the 
MyLocalPlugin example that comes with Ginga):

    $ cp MyPlugin.py $HOME/.ginga/plugins/.

To load it when the reference viewer starts (and add some logging to stderr
as well as to a file):

    $ ginga --plugins=MyPlugin --loglevel=20 --stderr --log=/tmp/ginga.log

To start the plugin from within the reference viewer, use the Plugin
Manager bar just below the color and readout bars.  Use the "Operation"
menu to select your plugin and it should be launched in the right panel.

If you don't see the name of your plugin in the Operation menu, then
there was probably an error trying to load it.  Examine the log and
search for the name of your plugin--you should find some error message
associated with it. 

If you select your plugin from the menu, but it doesn't launch a GUI,
there may be a problem or error in the plugin file.  Again, examine the
log and search for the name of your plugin--you should find some error
message associated with it. It may help for you to add some debugging
messages to your plugin (either using self.logger.debug("...") or simple
print statements to stdout) to gauge the progress of building the gui and
plugin starting.

If the plugin launches, but encounters an error building the GUI, it
should show some error messages (and probably a stack trace) in
placeholders in the right panel in the container where it tried to build
the GUI or possibly under the Errors tab.

.. note:: Ginga has a feature for quickly reloading plugins to
          facilitate rapid debugging cycles.  Start the "Debug" plugin
          from the "Plugins" menu in the menu bar.  If your plugin
          launched (but has some error), make sure you have closed your
          plugin by right clicking (or Control + click on Mac touchpad)
          on the small box representing your plugin in the Plugin
          Manager bar and selecting "Stop".  Then type the name of the
          plugin into the "Local plugin" box in "Debug" and press
          "Reload"--this will reload the python module representing your
          plugin and you should be able to immediately restart it using
          the Plugin Manager bar as described above. 

          If you have edited third party modules that are included in
          the plugin, this will not be enough to pick up those changes.

A more complex example: The ``Ruler`` Plugin
--------------------------------------------

Finally, in Listing 3 we show a completed plugin for ``Ruler``.  The
purpose of this plugin to draw triangulation (distance measurement)
rulers on the image.  For reference, you may want to refer to the ruler
shown on the canvas in Figure :ref:`fig2` and the plugin GUI shown in
Figure :ref:`fig6`.

This plugin shows a standard design pattern typical to local plugins.
Often one is wanting to draw or plot something on top of the image
below.  The ``ImageViewCanvas`` widget used by Ginga allows this to be
done very cleanly and conveniently by adding a ``DrawingCanvas`` 
object to the image and drawing on that.  Canvases can be layered on top
of each other in a manner analogous to "layers" in an image editing
program.  Since each local plugin maintains it's own canvas, it is very
easy to encapsulate the logic for drawing on and dealing with the
objects associated with that plugin.  We use this technique in the Ruler
plugin. When the plugin is loaded (refer to ``__init__()`` method), it
creates a canvas, enables drawing on it, sets the draw type and registers a
callback for drawing events.  When ``start()`` is called it adds that canvas
to the widget.  When ``stop()`` is called it removes the canvas from the
widget (but does not destroy the canvas).  ``pause()`` disables user
interaction on the canvas and ``resume()`` reenables that interaction.
``redo()`` simply redraws the ruler with new measurements taken from any new
image that may have been loaded.  In the ``__init__()`` method you will
notice a ``setSurface()`` call that associates this canvas with a
``ImageView``-based widget--this is the key for the canvas to utilize WCS
information for correct plotting.
All the other methods shown are support methods for doing the ruler
drawing operation and interacting with the plugin GUI. 

.. _sec-writing-global-plugins:

Writing a Global Plugin
-----------------------
The last example was focused on writing a local plugin.  Global plugins 
employ a nearly identical API to that shown in Listing 2, except that
the constructor does not take a ``fitsimage`` parameter.
``pause()`` and ``resume()`` can safely be omitted.  Like local plugins, 
``build_gui()`` can be omitted if there is no GUI associated with the plugin.

A template: MyGlobalPlugin
--------------------------

This is a skeleton for a global plugin, and serves as a decent example of
something that can be copied as a template for a global plugin.
This plugin is distributed with the Ginga package and can be loaded and
invoked from a terminal:

    $ ginga --modules=MyGlobalPlugin --loglevel=20 --log=/tmp/ginga.log

The plugin will be started at program startup and can be seen in the 
"MyGlobalPlugin" tab in the right panel.  Watch the status message as
you create new channels, delete channels or load images into channels.
