Ginga is a toolkit for building viewers for visualizing scientific data
in Python, particularly data represented in `numpy` arrays.  The Ginga
toolkit is based on a canvas/viewer/renderer paradigm.  The viewer includes
support for several target backends, including plain numpy arrays,
widget sets `gtk` (v2), `qt` (v4 and 5), `pyside`, `tk`, `matplotlib`
and `HTML5 canvas`.
