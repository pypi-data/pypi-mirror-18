The `contrib` folder is meant to be a primoridial soup of patterns and shapes for different collecting institutions.

Some examples/ideas:

work_creator - for modelling created works, such as art or design
natural_history - for modelling natural organisms
loc_classification - library of congress classification

Try to make use of what is here already, and feel free to contribute your own!

Over time, we will factor patterns out into more formal entities and standards that can then be tied together for each
project in different ways.
- e.g. Person > Creator > Author or Work > Artwork > Sculpture
