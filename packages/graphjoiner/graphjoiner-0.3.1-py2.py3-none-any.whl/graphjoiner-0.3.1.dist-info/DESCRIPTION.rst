GraphJoiner: Implementing GraphQL with joins
============================================

In the reference GraphQL implementation, resolve functions describe how to
fulfil some part of the requested data for each instance of an object.
If implemented naively with a SQL backend, this results in the N+1 problem.
For instance, given the query:

::

    {
        books(genre: "comedy") {
            title
            author {
                name
            }
        }
    }

A naive GraphQL implementation would issue one SQL query to get the list of all
books in the comedy genre, and then N queries to get the author of each book
(where N is the number of books returned by the first query).

There are various solutions proposed to this problem: GraphJoiner suggests that
using joins is a natural fit for many use cases. For this specific case, we only
need to run two queries: one to find the list of all books in the comedy genre,
and one to get the authors of books in the comedy genre.

Example
-------

Let's say we have some models defined by SQLAlchemy. A book has an ID, a title,
a genre and an author ID. An author has an ID and a name.

.. code-block:: python

    from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, Unicode, ForeignKey
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

    Base = declarative_base()

    class Author(Base):
        __tablename__ = "author"

        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        name = Column(Unicode, nullable=False)

    class Book(Base):
        __tablename__ = "book"

        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        title = Column(Unicode, nullable=False)
        genre = Column(Unicode, nullable=False)
        author_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey(Author.id))

We then define object types for the root, books and authors:

.. code-block:: python

    from graphql import GraphQLInt, GraphQLString, GraphQLArgument
    from graphjoiner import JoinType, RootJoinType, single, many, field
    from sqlalchemy.orm import Query

    def create_root():
        def fields():
            return {
                "books": many(
                    book_join_type,
                    books_query,
                    args={"genre": GraphQLArgument(type=GraphQLString)}
                )
            }

        def books_query(args, _):
            query = Query([]).select_from(Book)

            if "genre" in args:
                query = query.filter(Book.genre == args["genre"])

            return query

        return RootJoinType(name="Root", fields=fields)

    root = create_root()

    def fetch_immediates_from_database(selections, query, context):
        query = query.with_entities(*(
            selection.field.column_name
            for selection in selections
        ))
        keys = tuple(selection.key for selection in selections)

        return [
            dict(zip(keys, row))
            for row in query.with_session(context.session).all()
        ]

    def create_book_join_type():
        def fields():
            return {
                "id": field(column_name="id", type=GraphQLInt),
                "title": field(column_name="title", type=GraphQLString),
                "genre": field(column_name="genre", type=GraphQLString),
                "authorId": field(column_name="author_id", type=GraphQLInt),
                "author": single(author_join_type, author_query, join={"authorId": "id"}),
            }

        def author_query(args, book_query):
            books = book_query.with_entities(Book.author_id).distinct().subquery()
            return Query([]) \
                .select_from(Author) \
                .join(books, books.c.author_id == Author.id)

        return JoinType(
            name="Book",
            fields=fields,
            fetch_immediates=fetch_immediates_from_database,
        )

    book_join_type = create_book_join_type()

    def create_author_join_type():
        def fields():
            return {
                "id": field(column_name="id", type=GraphQLInt),
                "name": field(column_name="name", type=GraphQLString),
            }

        return JoinType(
            name="Author",
            fields=fields,
            fetch_immediates=fetch_immediates_from_database,
        )
    author_join_type = create_author_join_type()

We can execute the query by calling ``execute``:

.. code-block:: python

    from graphjoiner import execute

    query = """
        {
            books(genre: "comedy") {
                title
                author {
                    name
                }
            }
        }
    """

    class Context(object):
        def __init__(self, session):
            self.session = session

    execute(root, query, context=Context(session))


Which produces:

::

    {
        "books": [
            {
                "title": "Leave It to Psmith",
                "author": {
                    "name": "PG Wodehouse"
                }
            },
            {
                "title": "Right Ho, Jeeves",
                "author": {
                    "name": "PG Wodehouse"
                }
            },
            {
                "title": "Catch-22",
                "author": {
                    "name": "Joseph Heller"
                }
            },
        ]
    }

Let's break things down a little, starting with the definition of the root object:

.. code-block:: python

    def create_root():
        def fields():
            return {
                "books": many(
                    book_join_type,
                    books_query,
                    args={"genre": GraphQLArgument(type=GraphQLString)}
                )
            }

        def books_query(args, _):
            query = Query([]).select_from(Book)

            if "genre" in args:
                query = query.filter(Book.genre == args["genre"])

            return query

        return RootJoinType(name="Root", fields=fields)

    root = create_root()

For each object type, we need to define its fields.
The root has only one field, ``books``, a one-to-many relationship,
which we define using ``many()``.
The first argument, ``book_join_type``,
is the type we're defining a relationship to.
The second argument to describes how to create a query representing all of those
related books: in this case all books, potentially filtered by a genre argument.

This means we need to define ``book_join_type``:

.. code-block:: python

    def create_book_join_type():
        def fields():
            return {
                "id": field(column_name="id", type=GraphQLInt),
                "title": field(column_name="title", type=GraphQLString),
                "genre": field(column_name="genre", type=GraphQLString),
                "authorId": field(column_name="author_id", type=GraphQLInt),
                "author": single(author_join_type, author_query, join={"authorId": "id"}),
            }

        def author_query(args, book_query):
            books = book_query.with_entities(Book.author_id).distinct().subquery()
            return Query([]) \
                .select_from(Author) \
                .join(books, books.c.author_id == Author.id)

        return JoinType(
            name="Book",
            fields=fields,
            fetch_immediates=fetch_immediates_from_database,
        )

    book_join_type = create_book_join_type()

The ``author`` field is defined as a one-to-one mapping from book to author.
As before, we define a function that generates a query for the requested authors.
We also provide a ``join`` argument to ``single()`` so that GraphJoiner knows
how to join together the results of the author query and the book query:
in this case, the ``authorId`` field on books corresponds to the ``id`` field
on authors.
(If we leave out the ``join`` argument, then GraphJoiner will perform a cross
join i.e. a cartesian product. Since there's always exactly one root instance,
this is fine for relationships defined on the root.)

The remaining fields define a mapping from the GraphQL field to the database
column. This mapping is handled by ``fetch_immediates_from_database``.
The value of ``selections`` in
``fetch_immediates()`` is the selections of fields that aren't defined as relationships
(using ``single`` or ``many``) that were either explicitly requested in the
original GraphQL query, or are required as part of the join.

.. code-block:: python

    def fetch_immediates_from_database(selections, query, context):
        query = query.with_entities(*(
            fields[selection.field_name].column_name
            for selection in selections
        ))
        keys = tuple(selection.key for selection in selections)

        return [
            dict(zip(keys, row))
            for row in query.with_session(context.session).all()
        ]

For completeness, we can tweak the definition of ``author_join_type`` so
we can request the books by an author:

.. code-block:: python

    def create_author_join_type():
        def fields():
            return {
                "id": field(column_name="id", type=GraphQLInt),
                "name": field(column_name="name", type=GraphQLString),
                "author": many(book_join_type, book_query, join={"id": "authorId"}),
            }

        def book_query(args, author_query):
            authors = author_query.with_entities(Author.id).distinct().subquery()
            return Query([]) \
                .select_from(Book) \
                .join(authors, authors.c.id == Book.author_id)

        return JoinType(
            name="Author",
            fields=fields,
            fetch_immediates=fetch_immediates_from_database,
        )

    author_join_type = create_author_join_type()
