        Greenstack is a fork of greenlet, which is a spin-off of `Stackless`_, a
        version of CPython that supports micro-threads called "tasklets".  Tasklets run
        pseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads) and are
        synchronized with data exchanges on "channels".
        
        A "greenlet", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of
        micro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words. This is
        useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs. You can build
        custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet; however, it seems that
        greenlets are useful on their own as a way to make advanced control flow
        structures. For example, we can recreate generators; the difference with
        Python's own generators is that our generators can call nested functions and
        the nested functions can yield values too. Additionally, you don't need a
        "yield" keyword. See the example in tests/test_generator.py.  
        
        Greenlets are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodified
        interpreter.
        
        Greenlets are coroutines for in-process concurrent programming.

        Getting Greenstack
        ==================
        
        Currently, the only way to get Greenstack is by building it from source::
        
            git clone git@github.com:tbodt/greenstack
            cd greenstack
            ./setup.py install
        
        This will change soon.
