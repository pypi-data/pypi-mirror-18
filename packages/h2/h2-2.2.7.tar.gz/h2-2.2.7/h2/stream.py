# it needs to be able to reference the callbacks defined on the class, but
# because Python's scoping rules are weird the class object is not actually in
# scope during the body of the class object.

#    PP: PUSH_PROMISE frame (with implied CONTINUATIONs)
#    ES: END_STREAM flag
#    R:  RST_STREAM frame
#
# For the purposes of this state machine we treat HEADERS and their
# associated CONTINUATION frames as a single jumbo frame. The protocol
# allows/requires this by preventing other frames from being interleved in
# between HEADERS/CONTINUATION frames. However, if a CONTINUATION frame is
# received without a prior HEADERS frame, it *will* be passed to this state
# machine. The state machine should always reject that frame, either as an
# invalid transition or because the stream is closed.
#
# There is a confusing relationship around PUSH_PROMISE frames. The state
# machine above considers them to be frames belonging to the new stream,
# which is *somewhat* true. However, they are sent with the stream ID of
# their related stream, and are only sendable in some cases.
# For this reason, our state machine implementation below allows for
# PUSH_PROMISE frames both in the IDLE state (as in the diagram), but also
# in the OPEN, HALF_CLOSED_LOCAL, and HALF_CLOSED_REMOTE states.
# Essentially, for hyper-h2, PUSH_PROMISE frames are effectively sent on
# two streams.
#
# The _transitions dictionary contains a mapping of tuples of
# (state, input) to tuples of (side_effect_function, end_state). This
# map contains all allowed transitions: anything not in this map is
# invalid and immediately causes a transition to ``closed``.
