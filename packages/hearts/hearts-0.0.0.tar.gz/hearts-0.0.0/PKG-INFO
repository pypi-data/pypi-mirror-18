        # Hearts
        
        Hearts is a simple charting library, forked from <https://github.com/wireservice/leather>. The fork was made in order to explore API changes without concern for compatability. Many thanks to <https://github.com/onyxfish/ Christopher Groskopf> for open sourcing that code under a permissive license.
        
        Hearts is an experiment and not at all stable.
