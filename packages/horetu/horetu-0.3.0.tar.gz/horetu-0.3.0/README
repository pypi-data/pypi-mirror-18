horetu
======
Produce a user interface from a Python function.

Install the command-line interface tool like this. ::

    pip install 'horetu[all]'

The wsgi interface requires third-party libraries. Install just the
command-line interface, without the third-party libraries, like this. ::

    pip install horetu

I develop horetu on Python 3.5. It probably will work on 3.4 and higher.

Documentation is at https://pythonhosted.org/horetu/.
