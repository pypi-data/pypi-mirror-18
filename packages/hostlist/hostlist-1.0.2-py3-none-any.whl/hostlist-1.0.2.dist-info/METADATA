hostlist
========

Hostlist reads yaml lists with information about hosts and generates
config files and inventory for several services.

Configuration
-------------

The main configuration is based on a ``config.yml`` file in the working directory. 
Hostlists are collected in a directory listed in ``config.yml``.

Services
--------

At the moment the supported services are:

* /etc/hosts, can also be used for dnsmasq
* dhcpd
* ansible inventory
* munin 
* ssh_known_hosts generation

DNSVS Synchronization
---------------------

Besides generating config files, the hostlist can also be synchronized against
DNSVS, which is the dns management system used by https://www.scc.kit.edu.

Tests
