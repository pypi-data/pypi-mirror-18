ICEkit Press Releases
---------------------

This is a simple app to implement general-purpose Press Releases in
ICEkit projects.

Press Releases are publishable, and can contain fluent rich content and
downloadable pdf.

Also included is a Fluent Page type that lists press releases and serves
them at child URLs.

This app is useful as an example of how to create new rich content
models in ICEkit, and to make a mountable Page that lists them.
