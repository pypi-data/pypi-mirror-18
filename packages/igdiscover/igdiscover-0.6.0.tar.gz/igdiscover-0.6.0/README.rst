==========
IgDiscover
==========

IgDiscover analyzes antibody repertoires and discovers new V genes from high-throughput sequencing reads.
Heavy chains, kappa and lambda light chains are supported (to discover VH, VK and VL genes).

This tool is the result of work within the `Gunilla Karlsson Hedestam group <http://ki.se/en/mtc/gunilla-karlsson-hedestam-group>`_
at the `Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology <http://ki.se/en/mtc/>`_ at `Karolinska Institutet <http://ki.se/en/>`_,
Sweden.

IgDiscover was developed at `Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) <https://www.scilifelab.se/>`_
as a project within the `Bioinformatics Long-Term Support <https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/wabi/>`_ facility.
