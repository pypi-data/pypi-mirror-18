Description: Description
        -----------
        
        Some of the ``itertools`` operations do not work on infinite generators,
        this package is the beginning of the work to port some of the iterator
        concepts to the infinity.
        
        ``infinite`` is compatible with both python2 and python3.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The package has been uploaded to `PyPI`_, so you can
        install the package using pip:
        
            pip install infinite
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        For example if we want to iterate all the pairs of natural numbers:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from itertools import count
            from infinite import product
        
            for x, y in product(count(0), count(0)):
                print(x, y)
                if (x, y) == (3, 3):
                    break
