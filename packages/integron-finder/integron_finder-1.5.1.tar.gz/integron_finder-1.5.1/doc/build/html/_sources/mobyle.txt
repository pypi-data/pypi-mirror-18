Results
=======

Once the job is finished, you have a result page, which contains:

- integron_finder.out:
    Log of the run. It tells you how many integrons have been found for each types along with the number of *attC* sites per type.

- **Schema of complete integron(s)** : replicon_X.pdf
    Simple representation of one or more complete integrons found.
    The representation is very basic and a better representation can be
    obtained from the GenBank file and a software (eg Geneious) to represent it.
- **annotated sequence** : replicon.gbk
    The GenBank file of the input sequence with the annotation corresponding to
    the elements found (integrase, *attC*, promoter, attI, etc...).
- **putative integrons** : replicon.integrons
    A tabular file listing all the elements and their caracteristics.

Finally, you have your initial sequence of the replicon and the command line used.

For each of the aforementionned files, you can save them by clicking on the save
button |savebutton|.
