Description: Irisett -- A small API driven monitoring engine
        ================================================
        
        Irisett is a small, API driven monitoring engine. It is a simple but
        complete monitoring engine that uses nagios monitor binaries to perform
        service checks. Irisett does not come with a web interface. It is intended
        to be integrated with other systems and interfaces and is thus primarily
        accessed using a HTTP API. A basic command line client for communicating
        with the server is also provided.
