Iterable, InfiniteIterable and ManyIterables
--------------------------------------------

.. warning::
   :py:class:`~iteration_utilities.core.Iterable`,
   :py:class:`~iteration_utilities.core.InfiniteIterable` and
   :py:class:`~iteration_utilities.core.ManyIterables`
   are currently experimental.

``iteration_utilities`` introduces these three classes that can be used as
wrapper for Python iterables. These classes implement the generators present
in the Python builtins, the ``itertools``-module and ``iteration_utilities``
as methods.

These can be broadly classified in 4 categories:

Creating an Iterable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The constructor allows wrapping a specified `iterable` like a `list` or
`range` object. But it also has several staticmethods for creating an
`Iterable` by other means, these have the prefix ``from_``. For example the
:py:meth:`~iteration_utilities.core.Iterable.from_repeat` allows to create an
`Iterable` by using :py:func:`itertools.repeat`.


Modifying and chaining operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As soon as the `Iterable` is created one can process it. Each of the normal
(not prefixed methods) returns the result of the operation (as generator!)
so these can be arbitarly chained. This allows to chain several operations
sequentially.

This can be demonstrated best with an actual example. Suppose we have a list of
strings of numbers and we want to convert each letter to an integer and then
sum the numbers below 3::

    >>> # Python example
    >>> from itertools import chain
    >>> def less_than_three(x):
    ...     return x < 3
    >>> inp = ['12314253', '12368412612', '7812358', '12381531']
    >>> sum(filter(less_than_three, map(int, chain.from_iterable(inp))))
    23

    >>> # Example with Iterable
    >>> from iteration_utilities import Iterable
    >>> sum(Iterable(inp).flatten().map(int).filter(less_than_three))
    23


Conversion methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Iterable` implements the iteration protocol so it's possible to use it
everywhere where an iterable is needed. For example with ``for item in ...``
or to construct containers, i.e. ``list()``. For convenience (and to prevent
some problems with infinite iterables) finite `Iterables` also have methods to
convert them to the desired class. These are prefixed with ``as_``.
`InfiniteIterables` **don't** have these to avoid creating an infinitly long
`list`.

.. warning::
   However `InfiniteIterables` also implement the iteration protocol and could
   be passed to `list`, with severe consequences. So use the ``as_*`` and
   ``get_*`` methods which will still throw an ``AttributeError`` but at least
   they won't create an ``MemoryError`` or freeze your computer! You have been
   warned!

Currently folding methods like ``sum()`` are implemented with the prefix
``get_``.

.. note::
   See the documentation of :py:class:`~iteration_utilities.core.Iterable`
   to see which methods are possible or read the next chapters for more
   background information.

Operating on several iterables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `ManyIterables` class implements the methods that operate on several
iterables and return a single `Iterable` or `InfiniteIterable`.

However it is very important that the `iterables` given to `ManyIterables`
clearly indicate if they are infinite, otherwise the methods won't know if
the result should be finite or infinite. These infinite iterables should be
wrapped in `InfiniteIterable` or created by the ``Iterable.from_*`` methods.
