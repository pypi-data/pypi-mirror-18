Tipps and Tricks
----------------

Sometimes it is not hard to speed up some simple tasks. This page shows some
templates that might help to improve the performance of your code.

   facts to share please open a Pull Request or Issue.


Map
^^^

:py:func:`map` can be much faster than list comprehensions or generator
expressions *if and only if* the `function` is implemented in C without
Python attribute lookup.

All Python builtins are written in C and some (there are exceptions like
:py:func:`abs`) that perform really fast with :py:func:`map`:

.. code:: python

    >>> import random
    >>> l1 = [random.randint(0, 1000) for _ in range(20000)]
    >>> l2 = [random.randint(0, 1000) for _ in range(20000)]
    >>> l3 = [random.randint(0, 1000) for _ in range(20000)]
    >>> %timeit [min(i) for i in zip(l1, l2, l3)]  # doctest: +SKIP
    100 loops, best of 3: 4.94 ms per loop

    >>> %timeit list(map(min, l1, l2, l3))  # doctest: +SKIP
    100 loops, best of 3: 3.24 ms per loop

Sometimes it is not possible to use such a function directly with
:py:func:`map` but before you use :py:func:`functools.partial` you can always
use :py:func:`itertools.repeat`!

.. code:: python

    >>> from itertools import repeat
    >>> lst = [0]*100000
    >>> %timeit [isinstance(i, int) for i in lst]  # doctest: +SKIP
    100 loops, best of 3: 17.4 ms per loop

    >>> %timeit list(map(isinstance, lst, repeat(int)))  # doctest: +SKIP
    100 loops, best of 3: 7.99 ms per loop

.. note::
    Using :py:func:`itertools.repeat` is only faster for very **few**
    functions. :py:func:`isinstance` is one of those!


Predicate functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes one needs a predicate function or filter out some items. One little
(although sometimes impossible!) trick is to use methods as predicate:

.. code:: python

    >>> import random
    >>> from iteration_utilities import consume
    >>> lst = [random.random() for _ in range(200000)]
    >>> %timeit consume((i for i in lst if i > 0.5), None)  # doctest: +SKIP
    100 loops, best of 3: 9.51 ms per loop

    >>> %timeit consume(filter((0.5).__lt__, lst), None)  # doctest: +SKIP
    100 loops, best of 3: 8.03 ms per loop

This shows only a slight improvement but it's not always possible to use a
generator expression or list comprehension. If you do the same with
:py:func:`operator.lt` and :py:func:`functools.partial` or with a custom
function you'll see the performance increase:

.. code:: python

    >>> from functools import partial
    >>> from operator import lt
    >>> partial_gt_05 = partial(lt, 0.5)
    >>> %timeit consume(filter(lambda x: x > 0.5, lst), None)  # doctest: +SKIP
    10 loops, best of 3: 22.3 ms per loop

    >>> %timeit consume(filter(partial_gt_05, lst), None)  # doctest: +SKIP
    100 loops, best of 3: 17 ms per loop

.. warning::
    Using the ``__lt__`` and equivalent methods is not always possible, for
    example it's not possible in Python2 and this bypasses Pythons operator
    evaluation. For example the following will fail: ``(5).__lt__(10.2)``
    because integer don't compare to floats. In that case you need to use:
    ``(5.0).__lt__(10.2)``.

However public methods are always avaiable as well as several special methods
like: ``__len__``, ``__contains__``, ...
