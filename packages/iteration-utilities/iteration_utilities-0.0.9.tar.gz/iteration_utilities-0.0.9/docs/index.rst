Welcome to iteration_utilities's documentation!
===============================================

``iterations_utilities`` is a general purpose collection around the concept of
functional programming. Most of the functions presented here are **inspired**
by the ``itertools`` [0]_ module, especially the "recipes" section, but also by
the ``toolz`` [1]_ package. It should be noted that there are lots more
packages with similar functions, for example ``more-itertools`` [2]_,
``pydash`` [3]_ and many, many more.

Large fractions of the code are implemented in C to achieve very good
performance. However this library cannot compete (intentionally) with
specialized libraries like ``NumPy``, ``pandas`` or ``SciPy``.

.. note::
   The documentation does not only present functionality from the
   ``iteration_utilities`` library but also includes links to several
   builtin modules and functions.

.. warning::
   This library is under ongoing development and may **not** be stable!
