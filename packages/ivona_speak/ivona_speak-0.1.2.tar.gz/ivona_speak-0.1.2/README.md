Python script that lets you easily convert passed text to synthesized audio
files, with help of Amazon's [IVONA][ivona]. All you need is a pair of 
[keys][ivona keys] and this script. Yes, that's *literally* everything you need
to never speak again. If that's your thing of course.

If you want to use IVONA Speech Cloud directly inside your Python project then
have a look at [python-ivona-api][ivona api], which this script also uses.

## Installation
From PyPI (recommended):
```
$ pip install ivona_speak
```

With `git clone`:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Pythonity/ivona-speak
$ pip install -r ivona-speak/requirements.txt
$ cd ivona-speak/bin
```

## Usage
The script comes with two subcommands (`synthesize` is the default one):
```
$ ivona-speak synthesize -h
Usage: ivona-speak synthesize [OPTIONS] TEXT

  Synthesize passed text and save it as an audio file

Options:
  --access-key TEXT          IVONA Speech Cloud access key.
  --secret-key TEXT          IVONA Speech Cloud secret key.
  -a, --auth-file FILENAME   Path to YAML file with 'access-key' and 'secret-
                             key' set.
  -o, --output-file PATH     Output audio file path.  [required]
  -n, --voice-name TEXT      Voice name (default: Salli).
  -l, --voice-language TEXT  Voice language (default: en-US).
  -c, --codec [ogg|mp3|mp4]  Used codec (default: mp3).
  -h, --help                 Show this message and exit.
```

```
$ ivona-speak list-voices -h
Usage: ivona-speak list-voices [OPTIONS]

  List available Ivona voices

Options:
  --access-key TEXT          IVONA Speech Cloud access key.
  --secret-key TEXT          IVONA Speech Cloud secret key.
  -a, --auth-file FILENAME   Path to YAML file with 'access-key' and 'secret-
                             key' set.
  -l, --voice-language TEXT  Filter voice by language.
  -h, --help                 Show this message and exit.
```

## Examples
With above usage everything should be pretty clear, but in case it isn't:  

You can provide keys either explicitly or put them in YAML file (one of those
ways is required):
```
$ ivona-speak list-voices --access-key 'YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_KEY' --secret-key 'YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY'
$ ivona-speak list-voices -a secrets.yaml
```

Also, `synthesize` is the default subcommand so those do the same:
```
$ ivona-speak synthesize -a secrets.yaml -o hello_world.mp3 'Hello world!'
$ ivona-speak -a secrets.yaml -o hello_world.mp3 'Hello world!'
```

List all available IVONA voices, and list them now:
```
$ ivona-speak list-voices -a secrets.yaml
```

I want someone to say 'Hello world!', and say it quick:
```
$ ivona-speak synthesize -a secrets.yaml -o hello_world.mp3 'Hello world!'
```

She sounds so nice. I want someone special to respond her:
```
$ ivona-speak synthesize -a secrets.yaml -o response.mp3 -n Joey 'How you doin?'
```

### Example auth file
```
$ cat secrets.yaml
access-key: YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_KEY
secret-key: YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY
```

## Tests
Package was tested with the help of `py.test` and `tox` on Python 2.7, 3.4
and 3.5 (see `tox.ini`).

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variables with secret
and access keys before running `tox`:
```shell
$ export IVONA_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_KEY"
$ export IVONA_SECRET_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY"
$ tox
```
