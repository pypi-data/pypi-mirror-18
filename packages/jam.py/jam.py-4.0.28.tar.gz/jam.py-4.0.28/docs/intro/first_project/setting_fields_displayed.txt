Setting up how the fields will be displayed
===========================================

When we opened the **Task** journal in the browser the fields in the table and 
in the edit form were displayed in the order they've been created. To change the 
way fields are displayed in a view form click on the **View** button to change 
the default order of the fields and to hide/show some of them. See 
:doc:`View Fields Dialog </admin/items/view_fields_dialog>`.

button. See
