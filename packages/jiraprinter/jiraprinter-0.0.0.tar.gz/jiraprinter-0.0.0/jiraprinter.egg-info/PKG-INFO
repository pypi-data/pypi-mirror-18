Description: # jira ticket printer
        
        Jira does not provide a nice printable layout for tickets and nicer printing
        options are costly. This script just wraps the jira-api to allow formatting
        using jinja2 templates. This way, tickets can easily be formatted in a printer
        friendly way.
        
        ## Getting started
        
        The jiraprinter works on python3 only.
        
        Set up a virtual environment
        
            $ mkvirtualenv jiraprinter
        
        and install the requirements into that virtual environment
        
            $ workon jiraprinter
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        You can run the command line tool by calling
        
            python jira.py export <Ticket-Id> [<Ticket-Id> ...]
        
        Here, angle brackets (`<>`) denote variable parameters and square brackets (`[]`) denote optional
        parameters. This is similar to unix `man` pages. You can start the web-interface for selecting
        tickets and printing them by calling
        
            $ python jira.py select
        
        The web-interface will then be available at `localhost:8080`.
        
        ## Setting your credentials
        
        It is recommended that you put the URL of your jira server as well as your
        credentials into separate environment variables. Your user credentials need to
        be passed in base 64 encoding, which can be done using the `prepare_token.py` script:
        
            $ ./prepare_token.py
            Please enter your jira user name: myname
            Please enter your jira password:
            fowkeofoakjdfolai
        
        That last name is your jira credentials in base 64 encoding. It is recommended
        that you set your jira credentials and the url of the server in your bashrc (if
        you use bash). To do so, add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` file.
        
            export JIRAURL=https://jira.mycompany/rest/api/2
            export JIRACREDENTIALS=fowkeofoakjdfolai
        
        Obviously, both the URL and the credentials are completely made up.
        
        ## Authentication error
        
        Error messages are typically rather long and complex. If you see a 401 status code somewhere at the end of the stacktrace, that means that you're not correctly authenticated. In that case, you might want to check your user name and password.
