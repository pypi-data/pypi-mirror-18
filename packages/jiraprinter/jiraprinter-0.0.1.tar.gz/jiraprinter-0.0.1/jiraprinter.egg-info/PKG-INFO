Description: jira ticket printer
        ===================
        
        Jira does not provide a nice printable layout for tickets and nicer
        printing options are costly. This script just wraps the jira-api to
        allow formatting using jinja2 templates. This way, tickets can easily be
        formatted in a printer friendly way.
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        The jiraprinter works on python3 only.
        
        Jiraprinter is on pypi, so you can simply run
        
        ::
        
            pip install jiraprinter
        
        To install it. This will also create the two commands ``jira.py`` and
        ``prepare_token`` used below.
        
        You can run the command line tool by calling
        
        ::
        
            $ jira.py export <Ticket-Id> [<Ticket-Id> ...]
        
        Here, angle brackets (``<>``) denote variable parameters and square
        brackets (``[]``) denote optional parameters. This is similar to unix
        ``man`` pages. You can start the web-interface for selecting tickets and
        printing them by calling
        
        ::
        
            $ jira.py select
        
        The web-interface will then be available at ``localhost:8080``.
        
        Setting your credentials
        ------------------------
        
        It is recommended that you put the URL of your jira server as well as
        your credentials into separate environment variables. Your user
        credentials need to be passed in base 64 encoding, which can be done
        using the ``prepare_token.py`` script:
        
        ::
        
            $ prepare_token.py
            Please enter your jira user name: myname
            Please enter your jira password:
            fowkeofoakjdfolai
        
        That last name is your jira credentials in base 64 encoding. It is
        recommended that you set your jira credentials and the url of the server
        in your bashrc (if you use bash). To do so, add the following lines to
        your ``~/.bashrc`` file.
        
        ::
        
            export JIRAURL=https://jira.mycompany/rest/api/2
            export JIRACREDENTIALS=fowkeofoakjdfolai
        
        Obviously, both the URL and the credentials are completely made up.
        
        Authentication error
        --------------------
        
        Error messages are typically rather long and complex. If you see a 401
        status code somewhere at the end of the stacktrace, that means that
        you're not correctly authenticated. In that case, you might want to
        check your user name and password.
