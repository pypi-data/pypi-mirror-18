Requirements
------------

``jnrbase``'s dependencies outside of the standard library are:

<none so far>

It should work with any version of Python_ 2.6 or newer, including Python 3.
If ``jnrbase`` doesn't work with the version of Python you have installed, file
an issue_ and I'll endeavour to fix it.

The module has been tested on many UNIX-like systems, including Linux and OS X,
but it should work fine on other systems too.

To run the tests you'll need nose2_.  Once you have nose2_ installed you can
run the tests with the following commands::

    $ nose2 tests
