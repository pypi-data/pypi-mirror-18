Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `bootstrap-slider`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`bootstrap-slider`: https://github.com/seiyria/bootstrap-slider/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.bootstrap_slider``) are published to some URL.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``slider`` from ``js.bootstrap_slider`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.bootstrap_slider import slider
          >>> slider.need()
