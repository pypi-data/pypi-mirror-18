About Junit
-----------

Junit is a widely used java test framework, it happens to produce a fairly
generic formatted test report and many non-java things produce the same files
(eg py.test) or can be converted quite easily to junit xml (cunit reports via 
xslt). The report files are understood by many things like Jenkins and various
 IDEs.

The format of junit files is described here: http://llg.cubic.org/docs/junit/

Testing
-------

Junit2html is kindly tested on Travis : https://travis-ci.org/inorton/junit2html
