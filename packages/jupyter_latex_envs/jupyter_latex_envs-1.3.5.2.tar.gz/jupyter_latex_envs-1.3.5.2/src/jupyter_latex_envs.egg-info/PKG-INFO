Description: (some) LaTeX environments for Jupyter notebook
        ==============================================
        
        This extension for Jupyter notebook enables to use some LaTeX commands
        and environments markdown cells.
        
        1. **LaTeX commands and environments**
        
           -  support for some LaTeX commands within markdown cells, *e.g.*
              ``\textit``, ``\textbf``, ``\underline``
           -  support for **theorems-like environments**, support for labels and
              cross references
           -  support for **lists**: *enumerate, itemize*,
           -  limited support for a **figure environment**,
           -  support for an environment *listing*,
           -  additional *textboxa* environment
        
        2. **Citations and bibliography**
        
           -  support for ``\cite`` with creation of a References section
        
        3. **Document-wide numbering of equations and environments, support for
           ``\label`` and ``\ref``**
        4. **Configuration toolbar**
        5. **LaTeX\_envs dropdown menu for a quick insertion of environments**
        6. **User's LaTeX definitions** file can be loaded and used
        7. **Export to HTML and LaTeX with a customized exporter**
        8. Environments title/numbering can be customized by users in ``user_envs.json`` config file.
        9. Styles can be customized in the ``latex_env.css`` stylesheet
        
        More environments can be simply added in ``user_envs.json`` or in the source file
        (``thmsInNb4.js``).
        
        It is possible to export the notebooks to plain :math:`\LaTeX` and html
        while keeping all the features of the ``latex_envs`` notebook extension
        in the converted version. We provide specialized exporters, pre and post
        processors, templates. We also added entry-points to simplify the
        conversion process. It is now as simple asIt is now as simple as
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            jupyter nbconvert --to html_with_lenvs FILE.ipynb
        
        or
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            jupyter nbconvert --to latex_with_lenvs FILE.ipynb
        
        to convert ``FILE.ipynb`` into html/latex while keeping all the features
        of the ``latex_envs`` notebook extension in the converted version. The
        LaTeX converter also expose several conversion options (read the
        `docs <https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html>`__.
        
        Demo/documentation
        ==================
        
        The ``doc`` subdirectory that constains an example notebook and its html
        and pdf versions. This serves as the documentation. A demo notebook
        ``latex_env_doc.ipynb`` is provided. Its html version is
        `latex\_env\_doc.html <https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html>`__
        and a pdf resulting from conversion to LaTeX is available as
        `documentation <https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/documentation.pdf>`__.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The extension consists in a package that includes a javascript notebook
        extension. Since Jupyter 4.2, this is the recommended way to distribute
        nbextensions. The extension can be installed
        
        -  from the master version on the github repo (this will be always the
           most recent version)
        -  via pip for the version hosted on Pypi
        -  as part of the great
           `Jupyter-notebook-extensions <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/Jupyter-notebook-extensions>`__
           collection. Follow the instructions there for installing. Once this
           is done, you can open a tab at ``http://localhost:8888/nbextensions``
           to enable and configure the various extensions.
        
        From the github repo or from Pypi,
        
        -  **step 1**: install the package
          
           -  ``pip3 install https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/archive/master.zip [--user][--upgrade]``
           -   or ``pip3 install jupyter_latex_envs [--user][--upgrade]``
           -   or clone the repo and install ``git clone https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs.git  python3 setup.py install``
        
        
        -  **step 2**: install the notebook extension
        
           ::
        
               jupyter nbextension install --py latex_envs [--user]
        
        -  **step 3**: and enable it
        
           ::
        
               jupyter nbextension enable latex_envs [--user] --py
        
        For Jupyter versions before 4.2, the situation is more tricky since you
        will have to find the location of the source files (instructions from
        @jcb91 found
        `here <https://github.com/jcb91/jupyter_highlight_selected_word>`__):
        execute
        
        ::
        
            python -c "import os.path as p; from jupyter_highlight_selected_word import __file__ as f, _jupyter_nbextension_paths as n; print(p.normpath(p.join(p.dirname(f), n()[0]['src'])))"
        
        Then, issue
        
        ::
        
            jupyter nbextension install <output source directory>
            jupyter nbextension enable latex_envs/latex_envs
        
        where ``<output source directory>`` is the output of the python command.
        
        Disclaimer, sources and acknowledgments
        =======================================
        
        Originally, I used a piece of code from the nice online markdown editor
        ``stackedit`` https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/187, where the
        authors also considered the problem of incorporating LaTeX markup in
        their markdown.
        
        I also studied and used examples and code from
        https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions.
        
        -  This is done in the hope it can be useful. However there are many
           impovements possible, in the code and in the documentation.
           **Contributions will be welcome and deeply appreciated.**
