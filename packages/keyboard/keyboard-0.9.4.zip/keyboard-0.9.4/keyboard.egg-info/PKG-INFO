Description: keyboard
        ========
        
        Take full control of your keyboard with this small Python library. Hook
        global events, register hotkeys, simulate key presses and much more.
        
        **API docs**: https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard#api
        
        **Installation**: ``pip install keyboard``
        
        -  Global event hook on all keyboards (captures keys regardless of
           focus).
        -  **Listen** and **sends** keyboard events.
        -  Works with **Windows** and **Linux** (requires sudo).
        -  **Pure Python**, no C modules to be compiled.
        -  **Zero dependencies**. Trivial to install and deploy, just copy the
           files.
        -  **Python 2 and 3**.
        -  Complex hotkey support (e.g. ``Ctrl+Shift+M, Ctrl+Space``) with
           controllable timeout.
        -  Includes **high level API** (e.g. ```record`` <#keyboard.record>`__
           and ```play`` <#keyboard.play>`__,
           ```add_abbreviation`` <#keyboard.add_abbreviation>`__).
        -  Maps keys as they actually are in your layout, with **full
           internationalization support** (e.g. ``Ctrl+รง``).
        -  Events automatically captured in separate thread, doesn't block main
           program.
        -  Tested and documented.
        -  Doesn't break accented dead keys (I'm looking at you, pyHook).
        -  Mouse support coming soon.
        
        Example:
        
        ::
        
            import keyboard
        
            # Press PAGE UP then PAGE DOWN to type "foobar".
            keyboard.add_hotkey('page up, page down', lambda: keyboard.write('foobar'))
        
            keyboard.press_and_release('shift+s, space')
        
            # Blocks until you press esc.
            keyboard.wait('esc')
        
        This program makes no attempt to hide itself, so don't use it for
        keyloggers.
