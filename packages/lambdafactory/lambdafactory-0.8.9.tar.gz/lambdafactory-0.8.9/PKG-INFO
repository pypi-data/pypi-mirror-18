Description: LambdaFactory is a library/tool/framework that eases the development of
        programming languages by allowing you to plug-in your parser, drive the factory,
        create your program representation and translate it Python, JavaScript,
        ActionScript or Pnuts (and you can add your own).
        
        LambdaFactory provides a fine-grained OO model to represent your program, and
        also offers a flexible architecture to insert your own program transformation
        passes (documentation, representation, analysis, optimization)
