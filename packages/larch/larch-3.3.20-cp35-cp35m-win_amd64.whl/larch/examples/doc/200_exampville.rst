Welcome to Exampville, the best simulated town in this here part of the internet!

Exampville is a simulation tool provided with Larch that can quickly simulate the
kind of data that a transportation planner might have available when building
a travel model.  We will use the first Exampville builder to generate some
simulated data.

.. testcode::

	import larch, numpy, pandas, os
	from larch.roles import P,X
	from larch.examples.exampville import builder_1

	nZones = 15
	transit_scope = (4,15)
	n_HH = 2000
	directory, omx, f_hh, f_pp, f_tour = builder_1(
		nZones=nZones, 
		transit_scope=transit_scope, 
		n_HH=n_HH,
	)

The builder creates a temporary directory, and produces a set of files
representing some network skim matrixes in openmatrix (OMX) format, as well
as three DT files containing data on households, persons, and tours, respectively.
We can take a quick peek at what is inside each file:
