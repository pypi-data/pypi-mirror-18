Description: # lektor-htmlmin
        
        HTML minifier for Lektor that automatically minifies generated .html files. This plugin is based on [htmlmin](https://github.com/mankyd/htmlmin).
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install lektor-htmlmin using Lektor's plugin installer:
        
        ```
        lektor plugins add lektor-htmlmin
        ```
        
        Or modifying your lektorproject file, adding the plugin to the packages section:
        
        ```
        [packages]
        lektor-htmlmin = 0.3
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To enable minification, pass the `htmlmin` flag when starting the development server or when running a build:
        
        ```
        lektor build -O my_build_folder -f htmlmin
        ```
        
        When the flag is present, htmlmin will overwrite all HTML files in the output directory with their minified counterparts.
        
        *Note:* The htmlmin plugin currently minifies every file in the project after a build.
        Not just files that have been changed. This should have no ill effects, but
        might increase build times if there are many files to minify.
