Description: LF Backup
        =========
        
        LF Backup stands for large file backup. The script has the following
        features:
        
        -  take a file list from a csv file or an SQL table and backup each file
           to object storage (e.g. swift)
        
        -  if the file has an atime within the last x days (configurable) take
           an md5sum of that file and store the md5sum in an attribute / meta
           data called md5sum (not yet implemented)
        
        -  check if the file is already in object store and do not upload if the
           file size and mtime is identical
        
        -  notify a list of email-addresses after finishing. attach list of
           files that were uploaded. create one file list per file owner
           (username)
        
        -  log every file that was uploaded to syslog, detailed logging of
           success and failure to enable storage team to monitor success /
           failure via splunk
        
        -  bash script lf-backup is a wrapper for python script lf-backup.py,
           lf-backup sources and sets env vars with credentials and lf-backup.py
           only reads environments vars
        
        -  main script lf-backup.py only uses swift functions in lflib.py.
        
        -  segment size should be 1GB, segment container name should be
           .segments-containername, object type is slo, not dlo
        
        -  backup with full path but replace prefix, for example a file
           /fh/fast/lastname\_f/project/file.bam would be copied to
           container/bucket bam-backup in account Swift\_\ *ADM*\ IT\_backup.
           The target path would be /bam-bucket/lastname\_f/project/file.bam
           ..... we would need a command option such as --srcroot or --prefix or
           something like that, e.g. --prefix=/fh/fast
