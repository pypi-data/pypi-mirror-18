Description: LF Backup
        ---------
        
        LF Backup stands for large file backup. The script has the following features:
        
        -  take a file list from a csv file or an SQL table and backup each file to object storage (e.g.
           swift)
        
        -  if the file has an atime within the last x days (configurable) take an md5sum of that file and
           store the md5sum in an attribute / meta data called md5sum (not yet implemented)
        
        -  check if the file is already in object store and do not upload if the file size and mtime is
           identical
        
        -  notify a list of email-addresses after finishing. attach list of files that were uploaded; create
           one file list per file owner (username)
        
        -  log every file that was uploaded to syslog, detailed logging of success and failure to enable
           storage team to monitor success / failure via splunk
        
        -  bash script lf-backup is a wrapper for python script lfbackup.py, lf-backup sources and sets env
           vars with credentials and lfbackup.py only reads environments vars
        
        -  main script lfbackup.py only uses swift functions in lflib.py.
        
        -  segment size should be 1GB, segment container name should be .segments-containername, object type
           is slo, not dlo
        
        -  backup with full path but replace prefix, for example a file
           /fh/fast/lastname\_f/project/file.bam would be copied to container/bucket bam-backup in account
           Swift\_\_ADM\_IT\_backup. The target path would be /bam-bucket/lastname\_f/project/file.bam a
           --prefix=/fh/fast removes the fs root path from the destination
