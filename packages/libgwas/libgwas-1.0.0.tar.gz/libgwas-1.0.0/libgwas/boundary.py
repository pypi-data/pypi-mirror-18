class BoundaryCheck(object):
    """Record boundary specifications from user to control traversal.

    Default boundaries are specified in numerical positions along a
    single chromosome. Users are permitted to provide boundaries in
    3 forms: Bases, Kilobasees and Megabases. All are recorded as
    single base offsets from the beginning of the chromosome (starting
    at 1).

    The valid setting doesn't mean the boundary object is invalid, only
    that no actual boundary ranges have been provided. This is done to
    allow the user interface code to be a little simpler (i.e. if the
    user didn't provide bounds using numerical boundaries, it can try
    instantiating a SnpBoundary and pass the relevant arguments to
    that object. If none are valid, then either can be used, at which
    point both act as chromosome boundaries or simple SNP filters)

    If chrom is specfied, all SNPs and boundaries are expected to
    reside on that chromosome.
