Description: Quick-and-dirty static site generator for Python 3 (exclusively)
        using jinja & markdown.
        
        This script generates the lillian.link static website from `_src`.
        
        I really just made this for fun and I knew exactly
        what I wanted in a static site generator:
        
          * `jinja2` for templates and pages (`_src/templates/`)
          * `markdown` for blog posts (`_src/markdown_blog/`), which can be
            categorized simply by organizing the markdown files into directories
        
        How it works:
            Every jinja2 template (HTML file) in `_src/templates/pages/`
            will be rendered to the project's root (wherever lilypad is
            being executed from/current working directory). For the blog,
            the following jinja2 templates are required:
        
              * `src_/templates/lilypad/category-index.html
              * `src_/templates/lilypad/blog.html
              * `src_/templates/lilypad/blog-article.html
        
            The `_src/markdown_blog/` directory is scanned for markdown files
            recursively (`*.md`). The filename must fit the format
            `YYYY-MM-DD_some-title`.
        
            This post:
        
              _src/markdown_blog/rants/2016-11-05_i-really-love-halloween.md
        
            ...would belong to the `rants` category, and would be rendered to
            `blog/rants/2016-11-05_i-really-love-halloween.html`. The above
            post would have a timestamp of 2016-11-05.
        
        Quickstart:
            Just modify some files in `_src` and then run this script!
        
              $ python lilypad.py
        
            If you want to test the site, just do this:
        
                $ python -m http.server 8000
        
            ... then open http://localhost/index.html in web browser.
