CHANGELOG
=========
Version 1.0.0
-------------
* Drop historical code and update documentation

Development was started with re-using of historic code,
but now it's clean package with minimal requirements
(funcsigs looks like copy-paste from inspect.signature + adoption to use on python 2.7
(Enum is not available, not using enum34 package)).

* Mark package as stable (tested by unit tests and external run).

Version 0.9.0
-------------
* get_arg_names and get_call_args now presents only for historical reasons

* logwrap now logs argument types as commentaries
(POSITIONAL_ONLY (builtins only) | POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD (standard) | VAR_POSITIONAL (e.g. *args) | KEYWORD_ONLY (Python 3+ only) | VAR_KEYWORD (e.g. **kwargs))
