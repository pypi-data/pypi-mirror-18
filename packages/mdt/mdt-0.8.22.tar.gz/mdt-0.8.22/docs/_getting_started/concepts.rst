Concepts
========

This section introduces the user to a few concepts that helps you to get started with using the Maastricht Diffusion Toolbox.

.. _concepts_protocol:

Protocol
--------
In MDT, the Protocol contains the settings used for the MRI measurements and, is by convention, stored in a protocol file
with suffix ``.prtcl``. Such a protocol file contains for every volume (rows) and for every setting (columns, tab separated)
a single value.

The following is an example of a simple MDT protocol file::

    #gx,gy,gz,b
    0.000e+00    0.000e+00    0.000e+00    0.000e+00
    5.572e-01    6.731e-01    -4.860e-01   1.000e+09
    4.110e-01    -5.254e-01   -7.449e-01   1.000e+09
    ...


And, a more advanced protocol file::

    #gx,gy,gz,Delta,delta,TE,b
    -0.000e+00  0.000e+00   0.000e+00   2.179e-02   1.290e-02   5.700e-02   0.000e+00
    2.920e-01   1.7100e-01  -9.409e-01  2.179e-02   1.290e-02   5.700e-02   3.000e+09
    -9.871e-01  -8.538e-03  -1.595e-01  2.179e-02   1.290e-02   5.700e-02   5.000e+09
    ...


The header (starting with #) is a single required line with per column name of the setting the values represent. The order of the columns does not matter but the
order of the header should match the order of the value columns. Furthermore, the names of the columns should match the names of the protocol parameters of the
model you are using this protocol for (see :ref:`protocol_parameters`).
All subsequent lines should contain tab delimited values and are interpreted as rows matching the volumes in the MRI dataset.
This setup automatically enables *multi-shell protocol* files, by just changing per volume the b-value. Note that MDT expects the columns to be in **SI units**.

The pre-provided list of column names is:

* **b**, the b-values in :math:`s/m^2` (:math:`b = \gamma^2 G^2 \delta^2 (\Deltaâˆ’\delta/3)` with :math:`\gamma = 2.675987E8 \: rads \cdot s^{-1} \cdot T^{-1}`)
* **gx, gy, gz**, the gradient direction as a unit vector
* **Delta**, the value for :math:`{\Delta}` in seconds
* **delta**, the value for :math:`{\delta}` in seconds
* **G**, the gradient amplitude
* **TE**, the echo time in seconds
* **TR**, the repetition time in seconds

Not all models need all of these settings and MDT will issue warnings if a required setting is missing. If no b-value is provided, MDT
will calculate one using Delta, delta and G. If the b-value and two out of three of ``{Delta, delta, G}`` are given, the provided b-value will take preference.
If at least three of ``{b, Delta, delta, G}`` are given the other value will be calculated automatically when required.

One can dynamically add column names to MDT as shown in :ref:`protocol_parameters`. A protocol can be created from a bvec/bval pair of files using the
command line, python shell or GUI. Please see the relevant sections in :ref:`analysis` for more details on creating a protocol.

Dynamic modules
---------------
MDT can easily be adapted and extended with new models using dynamically loadable modules placed in your home folder.
These modules are Python files placed in the ``.mdt`` folder in your home drive and are reloaded every time MDT is started.
Users are free to add, remove and modify these components, for more information see :ref:`dynamic_modules` for more information.
