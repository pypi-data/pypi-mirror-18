Mizoo rename all your photos with a description of what is in them. It uses Microsoft Computer Vision API's to describe what it sees on the image and rename the file to that description.

By naming your photos with a description of the content you will never have to dig up an old photo from your library ever again, just search for the content!

** Warning: Machines are not very good at captioning yet so don't trust this to much... ðŸ¤–
