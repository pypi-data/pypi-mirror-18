0.6.1 (2016-11-09)
==================

- Fix README; it was naming the csv-dialect option wrong.

0.6 (2016-11-09)
================

- Added the ``--csv-dialect`` option so you can indicate the CSV
  dialect to use.

- Added a ``europe`` dialect where the delimiter is ``;``, not
  ``,``. This to support Excel in Europe, as its CSV format is
  locale-dependent. (why...)

0.5 (2016-11-01)
================

- Initial public release.
