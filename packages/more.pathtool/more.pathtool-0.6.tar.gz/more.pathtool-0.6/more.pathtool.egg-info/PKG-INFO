Description: more.pathtool: info about paths in Morepath apps
        ================================================
        
        ``more.pathtool`` lets you create a tool that generates information
        about paths in a Morepath application. This way you can see exactly
        what paths a Morepath application supports, including views and mounted
        applications. It does this by reading the configuration information of
        a Morepath application.
        
        To create such a tool you do the following, for instance in 
        ``tool.py`` of your project::
        
          from more.pathtool import path_tool
          from .someplace import SomeApp
        
        
          def my_path_tool():
              SomeApp.commit()
              path_tool(SomeApp)
        
        where ``SomeApp`` is the application you want to query, typically the
        root application of your project.
        
        Now you need to hook it up in ``setup.py`` to you can have the tool
        available::
        
            entry_points={
                'console_scripts': [
                    'morepathtool = myproject.tool:my_path_tool',
                ]
            },
        
        You also need to include ``more.pathtool`` in your setup requirements.
        
        After you install your project, you should now have a ``morepathtool``
        tool available that lets you query your project for path information.
        
        By default the path tool generates a CSV file with information in it
        about paths in your application::
        
          $ morepathtool paths.csv
        
        You can open it in a spreadsheet application such as Excel or
        OpenOffice Calc. Note that if you your locale is European you have to
        add ``-csv-format=europe`` to set the CVS writer to use ``;``` as the
        delimiter instead of ``,`` so that Excel can read it.
        
        Columns
        -------
        
        The columns in the CSV file are as follows:
        
        path
          The URL path. If this is a named view, the view name is appended
          with a ``+``. If this is an absorb path, the ``/...`` is appended.
          If this is an internal view, the path will be ``internal``.
        
        directive
          The directive used.
        
        filename
          The filename in which this configuration was made.
        
        lineno
          The line number of the configuration.
        
        model
          A dotted name to the model class exposed.
        
        permission
          A dotted name to the permission used for the path. Or ``public`` if no
          permission declared, or ``internal`` if this is an internal view. ``path``
          and ``mount`` directives have no permission.
        
        view_name
          The view name predicate, if any. By default this is empty. ``path``
          and ``mount`` directives have no view name.
        
        request_method
          The request method predicate. By default this is ``GET` ``path`` and
          ``mount`` directives have no request method predicates.
        
        extra_predicates
          Whether there are additional predicates in use. Go to the actual code
          to see them.
        
        CHANGES
        *******
        
        0.6 (2016-11-09)
        ================
        
        - Added the ``--csv-dialect`` option so you can indicate the CSV
          dialect to use.
        
        - Added a ``europe`` dialect where the delimiter is ``;``, not
          ``,``. This to support Excel in Europe, as its CSV format is
          locale-dependent. (why...)
        
        0.5 (2016-11-01)
        ================
        
        - Initial public release.
