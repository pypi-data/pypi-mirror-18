Description: #MPU-6050 Python
        
        This program handles the I2C communication between a Raspberry Pi and a MPU-6050 Gyroscope/Accelerometer sensor.
        
        For this program to work you need to have I2C enabled on your Raspberry Pi and you need to have the python-smbus package installed.
        
        This project is available on pypi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mpu6050-raspberrypi/
