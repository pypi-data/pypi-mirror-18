        =========
        
        This is a framework that provides the ability to quickly and easily create games based on a
        two-dimensional matrix like Sokoban, Bomberman or maze puzzles in general. The playing
        field consists of rows and columns, and each intersection is defined by a cell. Each cell can
        contain objects (walls, items, players, opponents, etc.) that represent the structure of the
        game.
