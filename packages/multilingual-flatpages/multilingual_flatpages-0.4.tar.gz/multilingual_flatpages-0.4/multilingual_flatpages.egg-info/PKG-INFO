Summary: A flatpage is a simple object with a URL, title and content. Use it for one-off, special-case pages, such as “About” or “Privacy Policy” pages, that you want to store in a database but for which you don’t want to develop a custom Django application. A flatpage can use a custom template or a default, systemwide flatpage template. It can be associated with one, or multiple, sites. This version is a fork of django.contrib.flatpages package made it multilingual.
