=========================================
Consistent versioning for NatCap Projects
=========================================

This package provides a consistent versioning scheme for projects of the
Natural Capital Project (http://naturalcapitalproject.org).  The versioning
string currently provided is PEP440-compliant, and is supported for both git
and mercurial repositories.  Mercurial source archives (created by the
``hg archive`` command) are also supported.

Versioning Scheme
=================

How a version string is formatted: ::

    If we are at a tag:
        version = {tag}
    else:
        version = {tag}.post{N}+r{nodeid|short}

    If there are no tags:
        {tag} = 'null'


Examples:

 * **Version string** = ``3.4.5``

   * Meaning: This version of this tool was built from the tag ``3.4.5``.

   * You can update to this revision by calling ``hg update -r 3.4.5``

 * **Version string =** ``3.4.5.post35+r788a29c99234``

   * Meaning: This version of this tool was built from a revision where:

     * The latest tag was ``3.4.5``

     * The latest commit on this branch is ``35`` commits beyond the latest tag.

     * The latest commit has a shortened node ID of ``788a29c99234``

   * You can update to this revision by calling ``hg update -r 788a29c99234``



Installation
============

**Via pip:** ``pip install natcap.versioner``

**Via setup.py:** ``python setup.py install``

.. note ::
    If you install ``natcap.versioner`` via pip or via setup.py, dependencies
    should install automatically.


Dependencies
============

Note that ``natcap.versioner`` requires setuptools and ``six``.


Usage In Your Project
=====================

To use this project, you'll need to edit two files within your own project:
``setup.py`` and ``__init__.py``.


Usage in setup.py
-----------------

Adding these lines to your ``setup.py`` allows the DVCS information to be
fetched from ``git`` or ``hg`` and recorded in the package metadata.
Additionally, the version will be recorded to the file you indicate with
the ``natcap_version`` keyword.

::

    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        name='example_project',
        ...
        natcap_version='example_project/version.py',
        setup_requires=['natcap.versioner>=0.4.2']
    )


Usage in __init__.py
--------------------

Adding these lines to your package's ``__init__.py`` file will allow the package
version to be fetched from the package metadata.

::

    # Let's assume your package name is still 'example_project'
    import natcap.versioner
    __version__ = natcap.versioner.get_version('example_project')
