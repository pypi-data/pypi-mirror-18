Description: Net-Survey
        ==========
        
        Net-Survey allows you to deploy agents throughout your infrastructure to
        gather network, interface, and ip configuration with the end goal of running
        a smart scan of basic reachability and port scans.  Server and agents deployed
        will progress through a series of steps once started:
        
        * Gathering of interface and network information.
        * Updating the central server.
        * Processing of topology information.
        * Distribution of topology data to clients.
        * Clients then proceed to scanning of neighboring hosts.
        * Retrieeval of test results.
        
        The benefit of Net-Survey is testing in situations where networks
        are isolated, i.e. a backend storage network.  It is also very fast as
        the targeted scan will scan only neighboring IPs with the interest of learning
        where setup issues exist on a new or existing infrastructure.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Simple install via pypi:
        
        ```
        pip install net-survey
        ```
        
        Command Line Usage
        ==================
        
        Server start:
        
        ```
        net-survey --mode server --inventory_file /home/user/myinventory
        ```
        
        Client start:
        
        ```
        net-survey --server_ip <server_ip>
        ```
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Ensure config file is installed during setup.  You might need sudo privileges
        to install net-survey as it creates /etc/net-survey.  The configuration file
        can be manually stated vie the --config-file param as well.
        
        Server start:
        
        ```
        net-survey
        ```
        
        Use the configuration file provided to set the mode to `server`. Optionally,
        adjust the API and Server ports to best fit your needs.
        
        
        Client start:
        
        ```
        net-survey
        ```
        
        Use the configuration file provided to set the mode to `client`. Set the IP
        Address of the server via `server_ip`, and optionally, adjust the options
        to best suite your needs.
        
        
        API Usage
        =========
        
        The API Server will respond to GET requests on / and return a JSON dump
        containing the results of a scan or the current status of a scan:
        
        ```json
        
        {
        "_host_detail":
            {
            "compute02":
                {"192.168.140.0/24":
                    {"ips": ["192.168.140.118"],
                    "results": {"192.168.140.117":
                        {"host": "compute01",
                        "result": "success",
                        "open_ports": [22]
                        }
                    }
                }, "192.168.100.0/24":
                    {"ips": ["192.168.100.118"],
                    "results": {"192.168.100.117":
                        {"host": "compute01",
                        "result": "success",
                        "open_ports": [22]
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            "compute01":
                {"192.168.140.0/24":
                    {"ips": ["192.168.140.117"],
                    "results": {"192.168.140.118":
                        {"host": "compute02",
                        "result": "success",
                        "open_ports": [22]
                        }
                    }
                }, "192.168.100.0/24":
                    {"ips": ["192.168.100.117"],
                    "results":
                        {"192.168.100.118":
                            {"host": "compute02",
                            "result": "success",
                            "open_ports": [22]
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            "_state": "sleeping",
            "_clients": {"compute02": "192.168.100.118", "compute01": "192.168.100.117"},
            "_networks":
                {
                    "192.168.140.0/24": ["compute02", "compute01"],
                    "192.168.100.0/24": ["compute02", "compute01"]
                }
        }
        
        ```
        
        The API Server can also control when a scan shall take place by issuing a
        POST to /start.  By default, the server service will not immediately start a
        scan, but this can be enabled by setting `scan_on_start` to `True`.
