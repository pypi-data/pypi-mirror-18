        Advanced network calculator and address planning helper.
        
        NetCalc is a tool made by network admins, for network admins. It supports
        adding (aggregating) networks, subtracting a network from a larger network,
        doing addition and subtraction of multiple networks at once, and more
        functionality is to come in future releases.
        
        NetCalc supports both IPv4 and IPv6, and works very efficiently even with very
        large networks. It uses the excellent netaddr_ library for the core address
        manipulation.
        
        This program requires either Python 3 (recommended) or Python 2.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Using NetCalc is quite simple. There are three main commands:
        
        add
          Add networks, aggregating as much as possible. ::
        
            $ netcalc add 198.18.0.0/24 198.18.1.0/24 10.1/16 10/16
            10.0.0.0/15
            198.18.0.0/23
        
        sub
          Subtract a network from another, splitting as necessary. ::
        
            $ netcalc sub 192.0.2.0/24 192.0.2.0/28
            192.0.2.16/28
            192.0.2.32/27
            192.0.2.64/26
            192.0.2.128/25
        
        expr
          Add and subtract networks using an arbitrarily long mathematical expression. ::
        
            $ netcalc expr 2001:db8::/34 - 2001:db8::/38 + 2001:db8:100::/41
            2001:db8:100::/41
            2001:db8:400::/38
            2001:db8:800::/37
            2001:db8:1000::/36
            2001:db8:2000::/35
        
        
        Future plans
        ------------
        
        Future plans for NetCalc include, in no particular order:
        
        - new command for static information (netmask/bitmask, IP range)
        - new command for WHOIS queries
        - new command for splitting a network into smaller networks by prefix length
        - ability to specify network arguments through a file
        - ???
        
        Suggestions are quite welcome :)
