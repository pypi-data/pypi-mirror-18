LBaaS 2.0 (STABLE)
==================

The Load-Balancer-as-a-Service (LBaaS) version 2.0 extension pairs with the
Networking 2.0 API to enable OpenStack projects to manage load balancers for
their VMs. With this extension you can load- balance client traffic from one
network to application services, such as VMs, on the same network.

Use this extension to create and manage load balancers, listeners, pools,
members of a pool, and health monitors and view status of a resource.

**Load balancer statuses**

+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Status         | Description                                                        |

Create load balancer
====================

.. rest_method::  POST /v2.0/lbaas/loadbalancers

Creates a load balancer.

This operation provisions a new load balancer by using the
configuration that you define in the request object. After the API
validates the request and starts the provisioning process, the API
returns a response object that contains a unique ID and the status
of provisioning the load balancer.

In the response, the load balancer provisioning status is
``ACTIVE``, ``PENDING_CREATE``, or ``ERROR``.

If the status is ``PENDING_CREATE``, issue GET
``/lbaas/loadbalancers/loadbalancer_id`` to view the progress of
the provisioning operation. When the load balancer status changes
to ``ACTIVE``, the load balancer is successfully provisioned and
operational for traffic handling.

If the API cannot fulfill the request due to insufficient data or
data that is not valid, the service returns the HTTP ``Bad Request
(400)`` response code with information about the failure in the
response body. Validation errors require that you correct the error
and submit the request again.

You can configure all documented features of the load balancer at
creation time by specifying the additional elements or attributes
in the request.

Administrative users can specify a project ID that is different than
their own to create load balancers for other projects.

**Example: Create a load balancer**

- ``project_id``. Admin only. Required to create a load balancer for
  another project.

- ``vip_subnet_id``. The network on which to allocate the VIP
  address for the load balancer. A project can only create load
  balancer VIPs on networks that the policy authorizes, such as her
  own networks or shared or provider networks.

Some attributes receive default values if you omit them from the
request:

- ``admin_state_up``. Default is ``true``.

- ``name``. Default is an empty string.

- ``description``. Default is an empty string.

If the API cannot fulfill the request due to insufficient data or
data that is not valid, the service returns the HTTP ``Bad Request
(400)`` response code with information about the failure in the
response body. Validation errors require that you correct the error
and submit the request again.

You can configure all documented features of the load balancer at
creation time by specifying the additional elements or attributes
in the request.

Administrative users can specify a project ID that is different than
their own to create load balancers for other projects.

If you own the subnet where you want to create the load balancer
VIP, you can specify a ``vip_address`` attribute. If you omit the
``vip_address`` attribute from the payload, the LBaaS service
allocates a VIP address from the subnet of the load balancer VIP.

An optional ``flavor`` attribute can be passed to enable dynamic
selection of an appropriate provider if configured by the operator.
The basic selection algorithm chooses the provider in the first
service profile currently associated with flavor.

You can also specify the ``provider`` attribute when you create a
load balancer. You can set this attribute to any service provider
with a ``LOADBALANCER`` service type. Setting both a flavor and a
provider will result in a conflict error.

Finally, ``vip_network_id`` can be used in place of
``vip_subnet_id``. When this option is used, the VIP port is
created on the given network using the default behavior. If
assigned multiple fixed IPs, an IPv4 addresses is chosen as the
VIP in preference to IPv6 addresses.

Response Example
----------------

.. literalinclude:: samples/lbaas/listeners-list-response.json
   :language: javascript

Create listener
===============

.. rest_method::  POST /v2.0/lbaas/listeners

Creates a listener.

This operation provisions a new listener by using the configuration
that you define in the request object. After the request is
validated and the provisioning process begins, a response object is
returned. The object contains a unique identifier.

At a minimum, you must specify these listener attributes:

- ``project_id``. Admin only. Required to create a listener for
  another project.

- ``loadbalancer_id``. The load balancer on which to provision this
  listener. A project can only create listeners on load balancers
  that the policy authorizes. For example, her own load balancers.

- ``description``. The load balancer description.

- ``protocol``. The protocol for which the front end listens. Must
  be ``HTTP``, ``HTTPS``, ``TCP``, or ``TERMINATED_HTTPS``.

Some attributes receive default values if you omit them from the
request:

- ``protocol_port``. The port on which the front end listens. Must
  be an integer from 1 to 65535.

- ``default_tls_container_ref``. The reference to a container that
  holds TLS secrets. If you also specify ``sni_container_refs``,
  this container is the default. This parameter is required for the
  ``TERMINATED_HTTPS`` protocol.

- ``sni_container_refs``. A list of references to containers that
  hold TLS secrets for server name indication (SNI). This parameter
  is required for the ``TERMINATED_HTTPS`` protocol.

- ``admin_state_up``. Default is ``true``.

- ``name``. Default is an empty string.

- ``description``. Default is an empty string.

- ``connection_limit``. Default is ``-1``, which indicates an
  infinite limit.

If the API cannot fulfill the request due to insufficient data or
data that is not valid, the service returns the HTTP ``Bad Request
(400)`` response code with information about the failure in the
response body. Validation errors require that you correct the error
and submit the request again.

You can configure all documented features of the listener at
creation time by specifying the additional elements or attributes
in the request.

Administrative users can specify a project ID that is different than
their own to create listeners for other projects.

To update a listener, the load balancer to which to attach must
have an ``ACTIVE`` provisioning status.

Create pool
===========

.. rest_method::  POST /v2.0/lbaas/pools

Creates a pool.

This operation provisions a pool by using the configuration that
you define in the request object. After the API validates the
request and starts the provisioning process, the API returns a
response object, which contains a unique ID.

At a minimum, you must specify these pool attributes:

- ``project_id``. Admin only. Required to create a pool for another
  project.

- ``protocol``. The protocol for which this pool and its members
  listen. A valid value is ``TCP``, ``HTTP``, or ``HTTPS``.

- ``lb_algorithm``. The load-balancer algorithm, such as
  ``ROUND_ROBIN``, ``LEAST_CONNECTIONS``, and ``SOURCE_IP``, that
  distributes traffic to the pool members. The load-balancer
  provider must support this algorithm.

- ``listener_id``. The UUID of the listener in which this pool
  becomes the default pool. Each listener has only one default
  pool.

Some attributes receive default values if you omit them from the
request:

- ``admin_state_up``. Default is ``true``.

- ``name``. Default is an empty string.

- ``description``. Default is an empty string.

- ``session_persistence``. Default is an empty dictionary.

If the API cannot fulfill the request due to insufficient data or
data that is not valid, the service returns the HTTP ``Bad Request
(400)`` response code with information about the failure in the
response body. Validation errors require that you correct the error
and submit the request again.

Users can configure all documented features at creation time by
providing the additional elements or attributes in the request.

Administrative users can specify a project ID that is different than
their own to create pools for other projects.

To update a pool, the load balancer to which to attach must have an
``ACTIVE`` provisioning status.

Add member to pool
==================

.. rest_method::  POST /v2.0/lbaas/pools/{pool_id}/members

Adds a member to a pool.

This operation provisions a member and adds it to a pool by using
the configuration that you define in the request object. After the
API validates the request and starts the provisioning process, it
returns a response object, which contains a unique ID.

At a minimum, you must specify these pool attributes:

- ``project_id``. Admin only. Required to create a pool for another
  project.

- ``address``. The IP address of the member to receive traffic from
  the load balancer.

- ``protocol_port`` The port on which the member listens for
  traffic.

Some attributes receive default values if you omit them from the
request:

- ``admin_state_up``. Default is ``true``.

- ``weight``. Default is ``1``.

If you omit the ``subnet_id`` parameter, LBaaS uses the
``vip_subnet_id`` parameter value for the subnet UUID.

If the request fails due to incorrect data, the service returns the
HTTP ``Bad Request (400)`` response code with information about the
failure in the response body. Validation errors require that you
correct the error and submit the request again.

To configure all documented member features at creation time,
specify additional elements or attributes in the request.

Administrative users can specify a project ID that is different than
their own to create members for other projects.

To update a member, the load balancer must have an ``ACTIVE``
provisioning status.

Show pool member details
========================

.. rest_method::  GET /v2.0/lbaas/pools/{pool_id}/members/{member_id}

Shows details for a pool member.

This operation returns a member object identified by ``member_id``
that belongs to a pool object identified by ``pool_id``. If you are
not an administrative user and the pool or member object does not
belong to your project, the service returns the HTTP
``Forbidden (403)`` response code.

If this operation succeeds, it returns a pool element.

HTTP ``OK (200)`` response code.

Note: You cannot update the member UUID, ``project_id``,
``address``, ``protocol_port``, and ``subnet_id`` attributes. If
you attempt to update any of these attributes, the service returns
the HTTP ``Immutable (422)`` response code.

Note: You cannot update a member if the attached load balancer does
not have an ``ACTIVE`` provisioning status.

Create health monitor
=====================

.. rest_method::  POST /v2.0/lbaas/health_monitors

Creates a health monitor.

This operation provisions a health monitor by using the
configuration that you define in the request object. After the API
validates the request and start the provisioning process, it
returns a response object. The object contains a unique identifier.

At a minimum, you must specify these health monitor attributes:

- ``project_id``. Admin only. Required to create a health monitor for
  another project.

- ``type``. The type of health monitor. A valid value is ``TCP``,
  ``HTTP``, or ``HTTPS``.

- ``delay``. The interval, in seconds, between health checks.

- ``timeout``. The time, in seconds, after which a health check
  times out.

- ``max_retries``. Number of failed health checks before marked as
  OFFLINE.

- ``pool_id``. The pool to monitor.

Some attributes receive default values if you omit them from the
request, and are only useful when you specify a health monitor type
of HTTP(S):

- ``http_method``. Default is ``GET``.

- ``url_path``. Default is ``/``.

- ``expected_codes``. The expected HTTP status codes to get from a
  successful health check. Default is ``200``.

- ``admin_state_up``. Default is ``true``.

If the API cannot fulfill the request due to insufficient data or
data that is not valid, it returns the ``Bad Request (400)``
response code with information about the nature of the failure in
the response body. Failures in the validation process are non-
recoverable and require that you correct the cause of the failure
and submit the request again.

You can configure all documented features of the health monitor at
creation time by specifying the additional elements or attributes
in the request.

Administrative users can specify a project ID that is different than
their own to create health monitors for other projects.

To update a health monitor, the load balancer to which to attach
must have an ``ACTIVE`` provisioning status.
