 Nitime: timeseries analysis for neuroscience data
===================================================

Nitime is library of tools and algorithms for the analysis of time-series data
from neuroscience experiments. It contains a implementation of numerical
algorithms for time-series analysis both in the time and spectral domains, a
set of container objects to represent time-series, and auxiliary objects that
expose a high level interface to the numerical machinery and make common
analysis tasks easy to express with compact and semantically clear code.
