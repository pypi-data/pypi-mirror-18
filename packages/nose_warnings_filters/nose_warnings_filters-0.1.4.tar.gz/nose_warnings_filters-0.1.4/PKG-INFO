Metadata-Version: 1.2
Name: nose_warnings_filters
Version: 0.1.4
Summary: Allow to inject warning filters during ``nosetest``.

Put the same arguments as ``warnings.filterwarnings`` in ``setup.cfg``
at the root of your project. Separated each argument by pipes ``|``, one
filter per line. Whitespace are stripped.

for example:

::

    [nosetests]
    warningfilters=default         |.*            |DeprecationWarning |notebook.*
                   ignore          |.*metadata.*  |DeprecationWarning |notebook.*
                   once            |.*schema.*    |UserWarning        |nbfor.*
                   error           |.*warn.*      |DeprecationWarning |notebook.services.contents.manager*

If you prefer another name for the configuration file, you can tell nose
to load the configuration using the ``-c`` flag: run the tests with
``nosetests -c nose.cfg``.

details configuration.
======================

Each line of warning filter is separated in maximum 4 sections, that
match the first 4 sections of ``filterwarnings``:

.. code:: python

    filterwarnings(action, message="", category=Warning, module="", lineno=0, append=False)

fields 2 to 4 can be omitted, ie to say 1 line can be of the following
form:

::

    action
    action| message
    action| message | category
    action| message | category | module

the value of each fields is treated the same as for ``filterwarnigns``
except: - whitespace are trimmed. - if the ``category`` has dots, the
corresponding class try to be imported. If it does not have dots, the
name is looked up in ``builtins`` or ``__builtins__``

test are failing
================

For some reasons in some systems tests are failing; it seem that this
package have difficulty to self-test. That's likely due to the fact that
the tested package need to be in different namespaces, and by
self-testing we break this assumption.
