Description: Python scripts for openstack-mentoring
        =======================
        
        These scripts work on the google docs spreadsheets.  Come to the mentoring meetings
        if you want access to the spreadsheets.  More information on mentoring, sponsored by
        the Women of OpenStack is here: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mentors
        
        ----
        
        These scripts will match mentors and mentees and will generate a few types of emails:
        One is for when a match is found, it gives the mentor and mentee information and
        explains the reasons for the match.
        One is for when a match is not found, it gives the mentee hope that a match will be
        found.
        The last is when a mentee has not given enough information to find a match, that is
        there is no information in goal or area of interest to generate a match for them.
