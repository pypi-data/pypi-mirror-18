What's ``openxmllib``
=====================

``openxmllib`` is a Python package that processes Open XML documents and renders
them in various ways.

Open XML is the office document format supported natively by MS Office 2007, and
as import/export format by Apple iWork'08 and OpenOffice 2.2.

Open XML format is specified by the `ECMA-376 standard
<http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm>`_ and
now recorded as ISO/IEC standard ISO/IEC 29500.

Some starters about this format are available at `Wikipedia page about ECMA-376
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMA-376>`_. Wikipedia has another page that
`lists the softwares that support this format
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_that_supports_Office_Open_XML>`_.
