# Osmium example programs

The programs in this directory are intended as examples for developers. They
contain extensive comments explaining what's going on. Note that the examples
only cover a small part of what Osmium can do, you should also read the
documentation and API documentation.

All programs can be run without arguments and they will tell you how to run
them.

## Very simple examples

* `osmium_read`
* `osmium_count`
* `osmium_debug`
* `osmium_tiles`

## Still reasonably simple examples

* `osmium_filter_discussions`
* `osmium_convert`

## More advanced examples
