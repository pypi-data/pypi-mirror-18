Build process security hardening
-------

**Description:**

Building you application should always be done on a server that you trust, you are in control and 
has the latest security patches and hardening configured. In some applications you can use security 
techniques and modules that can protect your application from know security issues. Always use these 
techniques when they are available.

**Solution:**

Ensure that build processes for system level languages have all security flags enabled, such as 
ASLR, DEP, and other security checks specific for your application need.
