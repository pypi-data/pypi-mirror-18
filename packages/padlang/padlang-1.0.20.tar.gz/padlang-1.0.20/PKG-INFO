        ==========================================
        
        Yet another language written in Python.
        
        Contains
        --------
        
        -  Basic parser for converting tokens into AST (Abstract syntax tree).
        -  Interpreter. Handles the flow of instructions in AST.
        -  Contains basic types: Integer, Real, String.
        -  Class support, inheritance.
        -  List and dictionary support.
        -  Scope module imports, global program imports.
        -  Class member call support, which supports local and Python object
           members. (ie. you can call append on your list, but also call member
           of class declared locally.)
        -  Scoping, ie. scope can have its own local variables and still access
           those declared in outer scope.
        -  Methods with their own scope. They clone program's main scope rules,
           therefore they support nested methods.
        -  Conditional statements
        -  Case switch
        -  Basic variable existence checks when using variables.
        -  Variable references (ex. you can pass variable reference to a
           procedure, which can then modify it.)
        
        How to use
        ----------
        
        -  Either clone the repo or ``pip install padlang``, see *samples* for
           an example of how to use the package.
