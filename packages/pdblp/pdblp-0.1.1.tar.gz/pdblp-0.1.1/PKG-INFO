Description: pdblp
        =====
        
        This is a simple interface to integrate pandas and the Bloomberg Open
        API. The standard Bloomberg API provides an extensive set of features
        for building applications on top of however does not provide easy and
        interactive access to data. This package provides several functions for
        accessing historical market data and reference data. A simple set of
        examples is available
        `here <https://matthewgilbert.github.io/pdblp/tutorial.html>`__.
        
        The library borrows heavily from a similar package available
        `here <https://github.com/kyuni22/pybbg>`__

        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Once ``pdblp`` has been installed, documentation can be built using
        
        ::
        
            cd doc
            make html
        
        and then viewed in ./doc/\_build. Before building this ensure that you
        are logged into a Bloomberg terminal as this is required for building
        many of the examples.
