Peewee DB Evolve
================

Diffs your models against your database, and outputs SQL to
(non-destructively) update your schema.

Think of it as ``db.create_tables()`` on steriods (which doesn't drop
your database).

You can also think of it as schema migrations, without having to
actually write the migrations.

Quick Start
-----------

1. Run:
   ``sudo pip install git+git://github.com/keredson/peewee-db-evolve.git``
2. Add ``import peeweedbevolve`` anywhere before your models are
   defined.
3. Run ``db.evolve()`` where you would have normally run
   ``db.create_tables()``, and enjoy!

Example
-------

See our `Hello
World <https://github.com/keredson/peewee-db-evolve/tree/master/examples/hello_world>`__
example.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

*Does this work with existing projects, or only with new projects?*

This works very well with existing projects. If your API only works with
new projects, you're probably doing it wrong.

*Don't you give up control by not writing your own migrations?*

Managing your schema by writing your own migrations is kind of like
managing your source code by writing your own ``patch`` files in
addition to writing your actual code. A well vetted ``diff`` tool is
going to be better and faster at it than you.

*How old / well vetted is this tool?*

I wrote this in August 2016, but it's a port of a tool I've been using
for ~10 years now. (Called
`deseb <https://github.com/keredson/deseb>`__, funded by Google's Summer
of Code project in 2006, written for Django's ORM.) There is also a
`version for Ruby on
Rails <https://github.com/keredson/ruby-db-evolve>`__, which has been
used daily in production for ~1.5 years now. (We're switching to Peewee,
hence why I'm doing this port.)
