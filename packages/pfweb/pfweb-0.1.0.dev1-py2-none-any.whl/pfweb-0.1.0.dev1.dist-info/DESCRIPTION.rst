pfweb
-----

pfweb is a python web application to manage the OpenBSD Packet Filter (PF). It 
uses *py-pf* to interface with PF and Flask for the web framework. The look 
and feel is based on pfSense and a lot of the ideas are ripped off from them.

pfweb is designed with few dependencies and strives to use only included Python
modules.
