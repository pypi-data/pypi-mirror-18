# Manipulating geometry 1 - Basic movement and rotation
#==============================================================================
# There are several actions we can take to move and rotate the geometry.  These
# actions include movement, rotation, and reflection.

wg1.move([10,4]) # Shift the second waveguide we created over by dx = 10, dy = 4
wg2.move(origin = [1,1], destination = [2,2]) # Shift the second waveguide over by dx = 1, dy = 1
wg3.move([1,1], [5,5], axis = 'y') # Shift the third waveguide over by dx = 0, dy = 4 (motion only along y-axis)
poly1.movey(4) # Same as specifying axis='y' in the move() command
poly2.movex(4) # Same as specifying axis='x'' in the move() command
wg3.movex(30,40) # Moves "from" x=30 "to" x=40 (e.g. shifts wg3 by +10 in the x-direction)

wg1.rotate(45) # Rotate the first waveguide by 45 degrees around (0,0)
wg2.rotate(30, center = [1,1]) # Rotate the second waveguide by 30 degrees around (1,1)

wg1.reflect(p1 = [1,1], p2 = [1,3]) # Reflects wg3 across the line formed by p1 and p2


#==============================================================================
# Manipulating geometry 2 - Properties
#==============================================================================
# Each Device and DeviceReference object has several properties which can be used to learn
# information about the object (for instance where it's center coordinate is).  Several
# of these properties can actually be used to move the geometry by assigning them
# new values

wg1.bbox # Will return the bounding box of wg1 in terms of [(xmin, ymin), (xmax, ymax)]
wg1.xsize # Will return the width of wg1 in the x dimension
wg1.ysize # Will return the height of wg1 in the y dimension

wg1.center # Gives you the center coordinate of its bounding box
wg1.center = [4,4] # Shift wg1 such that the center coordinate of its bounding box is at (4,4)

wg2.xmax # Gives you the rightmost (+x) edge of the wg2 bounding box
wg2.xmax = 25 # Moves wg2 such that it's rightmost edge is at x = 25

wg3.ymin # Gives you the bottommost (+y) edge of the wg3 bounding box
wg3.ymin = -14 # Moves wg3 such that it's bottommost edge is at y = -14


quickplot(D)


#==============================================================================
# Manipulating geometry 3 - Smarter movement with ports
#==============================================================================
# All the waveguides we made have two ports: 'wgport1' and 'wgport2'  We can 
# use these names in place of (x,y) pairs.  For instance, if we want to move
# wg1 such that its port 'wgport1' rests on the origin, we do:
wg1.move(origin = 'wgport1', destination = [0,0])
# Alternatively, we can use the Port object itself in the same manner.  We can
# access the Port objects for any Device (or DeviceReference) by calling device.ports,
# --which returns a Python dictionary--and accessing its value with the key
wg3.move(origin = wg3.ports['wgport1'], destination = [0,0])
# We can even move one port to another 
wg2.move(origin = wg2.ports['wgport1'], destination = wg3.ports['wgport2'])
# Several functions beyond just move() can take Ports as inputs
wg1.rotate(angle = -60, center = wg1.ports['wgport2'])
wg3.reflect(p1 = wg3.ports['wgport1'].midpoint, p2 = wg3.ports['wgport1'].midpoint + np.array([1,0]))

quickplot(D)


#==============================================================================
# Manipulating geometry 4 - Chaining commands
#==============================================================================
# Many of the functions in Device return the object they manipulate.  We can use
# this to chain commands in a single line. For instance this:
wg1.rotate(angle = 15, center = [0,0])
wg1.move([10,20])
# ... is equivalent to this expression
wg1.rotate(angle = 15, center = [0,0]).move([10,20])



#==============================================================================
# Connecting devices with connect()
#==============================================================================
wg1.connect(port = 'wgport1', destination = wg2.ports['wgport2'])
wg3.connect(port = 'wgport2', destination = wg2.ports['wgport1'])

quickplot(D)



#==============================================================================
# Adding ports
#==============================================================================
# Although our waveguides have ports, ``D`` itself does not -- it only draws
# the subports (ports of wg1, wg2, wg3) as a convience.  We need to add ports
# that we specifically want in our new device ``D``
D.add_port(port = wg1.ports['wgport2'], name = 1)
D.add_port(port = wg3.ports['wgport1'], name = 2)

quickplot(D)



#==============================================================================
# Taking things a level higher
#==============================================================================
# Now that we have our device ``D`` which is a multi-waveguide device, we
# can add references to that device in a new blank canvas we'll call ``D2``.
# We'll add two copies of ``D`` to D2, and shift one so we can see them both
D2 = Device('MultiMultiWaveguide')
mwg1 = D2.add_ref(D)
mwg2 = D2.add_ref(D)
mwg2.move(destination = [10,10])

quickplot(D2)

# Like before, let's connect mwg1 and mwg2 together then offset them slightly
mwg1.connect(port = 1, destination = mwg2.ports[2])
mwg2.move(destination = [30,30])

quickplot(D2)


#==============================================================================
# Routing
#==============================================================================
# Routing allows us to connect two ports which face each other with a smooth
# polygon.  Since we connected our two 
D2.add_ref( pg.route(port1 = mwg1.ports[1], port2 = mwg2.ports[2], path_type = 'sine', width_type = 'straight') )
quickplot(D2)


#==============================================================================
# Adding text
#==============================================================================
# The function text() creates a Device, just like waveguide.  Use it and 
# manipulate it like any other Device
t = D2.add_ref( pg.text('Hello\nworld!', size = 10, justify = 'center'))
t.move([0,40]).rotate(45)
quickplot(D2)


#==============================================================================
# Labeling
#==============================================================================
# This label will display in a GDS viewer, but will not be rendered
# or printed like the polygons created by the text()
D2.annotate('First label', mwg1.center)
D2.annotate('Second label', mwg2.center)
