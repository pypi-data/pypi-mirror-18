Like `pip freeze` but lists only the packages that are not
dependencies of installed packages.

Features
--------

Generates a requirements file without any packages that depend on
other packages in the file.

Usage
-----

Suppose you have installed in your virtualenv a couple packages. When
you run `pip freeze`, you'll get a list of all packages installed,
with all dependencies. If one of the packages you installed ceases to
depend on an already installed package, you have to manually remove it
from the list. The list also makes no distinction about the packages
you actually care about and packages your packages care about, making
the requirements file bloated and, ultimately, inaccurate.

On your terminal,Â run::

 $ pip-chill
 asciitree==0.3.1
 autopep8==1.2.4
 beautifulsoup4==4.4.0
 bleach==1.4.1
 cookiecutter==1.4.0
 coverage==3.7.1
 django-argonauts==1.0.1
 ...

Or, if you want it without version numbers::

 $ pip-chill --no-version
 asciitree
 autopep8
 beautifulsoup4
 bleach
 cookiecutter
 coverage
 django-argonauts
