pogoiv: Calculate possible IVs for your Pokemon
===============================================

In the augmented reality mobile game, Pokemon Go, you adventure around the physical world capturing Pokemon and
exploring new places.

When a Pokemon is caught, it has a number of hidden statistics that the more hardcore players of the game are interested
in uncovering.

This project implements a simple, reusable library that supports enumerating possible combinations of these hidden stats
for a given Pokemon's public information.

It is intended for use in other applications and includes a reference CLI that leverages the package's functionality.

We take a brute force approach to the problem in the main entry point module: pogoiv.iv_calculator

Features
--------

- Calculate possible IVs and levels for a Pokemon given the appropriate public stats.
- Calculate the above for multiple point in time snapshots of that Pokemon to narrow down possibilities.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pogoiv

Example Usage
-------------
Library:
