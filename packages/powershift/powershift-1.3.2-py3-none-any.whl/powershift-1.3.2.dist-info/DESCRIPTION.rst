This package provides a Python library for working with the open source
OpenShift Origin project and downstream OpenShift products from Red Hat.

The library will provide the capability to work with OpenShift/Kubernetes
resource objects, as well as endpoints for communicating with the OpenShift
REST API.

The package requires Python 3 and will not work with Python 2.
