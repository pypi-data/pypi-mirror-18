This work would not be possible without:

    * Andreas Zellers book "Why Programs Fail: A Guide to Systematic
      Debugging"; ISBN13: 9780123745156. It introduced me to the idea of
      program slicing.

    * Ned Batchelders code complexity micro tool. I've studied his
      program and taken a few implementation ideas on board. Thank you
      very much for this.

      Programs" thesis:
