        A simple command-line podcatcher.
        
        Supports Python 3.4+. Feel free to report any issues here, and I’ll investigate when/if I can.
        
        | You’ll need setuptools (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) to
          run this in its current state. Go get it, clone this repo, and you
        | can run the below commands. Should work on OSX and Linux, from the
          command line. You’ll want a default config file, name it config.yaml
        | and look at example\_config.yaml to see how it should be structured.
        
        Directory for config file:
        
        -  OSX: /Users/[USERNAME]/Application Support/puckfetcher/config.yaml
        -  Linux: /home/[USERNAME]/.config/puckfetcher/config.yaml
        
        Build + Install:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Test:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py test
        
        Complete
        --------
        -  Retrieve podcast feed.
        -  Get podcast file URL from feed.
        -  Download podcast file.
        -  Download a set number of podcasts from a feed’s backlog.
        -  Load settings from a file to determine which podcasts to download.
        -  Save settings to a cache to restore on application load.
        -  Intelligently merge user settings and application cache.
        -  Add script entry point to repeatedly update subscriptions.
        -  Use etags/last-modified header to skip downloading feeds if we
           already have the latest feed, to not waste bandwidth.
        -  PyPI release!
        -  Text-based progress for podcast downloads (via Clint).
        -  Clean up subscriptions code and get Pylint to like it.
        -  Provide summary of downloaded podcasts per-session.
        -  Provide summary of recently-downloaded podcast episodes.
        
        
        Future releases
        ---------------
        -  Text-based progress for other time-consuming actions.
        -  Add MP3 tag support to clean up tags based on feed information if
           it’s messy.
        -  Attempt to support Jython/PyPy/IronPython/3.4/3.3
        -  Allow parallel downloading.
