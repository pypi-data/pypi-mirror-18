        What is pwclip?
        ===============
        
        pwclip has two operating modes. One is for operating on yubikeys to generate
        uniq responses which might be used as passwords while they can be generated by
        that exact yubikey only. The first yubikey found on the system and the first
        slot, configured with (HMAC-SHA1) challenge-response, will be used. For that
        function Windows is supported (see "Install" section). For now python2.7 is
        still also supported but might be discontinued. Therefor it should be
        sufficient to just apply the installation for python2 likewise.
        
        To catch user input python's Tk (tkinter) library is used to create a simple
        password input window. The appropriate response is saved for only 3 seconds
        by default to not have it exposed as soon as it's used. The utility also
        supports the input of any integer which is then used as timer. Otherwise the
        environment is searched for PWCLIPTIME and uses the value of that environment
        variable as timer. The timer is used as time in which the received password
        stays in the paste buffer bevore its replaced by the previously copied value.
        
        The second operating mode does currently only work (and so far tested) on
        Linux due to gpg4win limitation. It can be used to create a ~/.pwdcrypt file
        which is gpg encrypted text using either the value of GPGKEYS as gpg
        recipients if found in environment otherwise every key within the users
        keyring will be used. For password-list managing there is a simple "import"
        function. On startup it lookes for a ~/.pwd.yaml file and if found merged with
        the already known passwords from the ~/.passcrypt there is one. All entrys in
        ~/.passcrypt will be overridden by the entrys from the ~/.pwd.yaml file. As
        soon as it has been merged the ~/.pwd.yaml file will be deleted.
        
        The accepted yaml format:
        -------------------------
        
        \-\-\-
        
        realsystemuser:
            \- somename:
                \- Som3(rypt!cPass
        
                \- Some optional info to display as popup notification
        
            \- othername:
                \- Som3other(rypt!cPass
        
        
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        pwclip requires the "xsel" package on Debian-Like Systems to have access to
        copy/paste buffers. On Windows Systems the libusb package must be integrated
        to python3 as "USB-Backend".
        
        * https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/xsel/
        * https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/
        * http://libusb.info/
        
        If you are on a Debian-Like system the installation of the dependencies
        should work like the following (on root terminal):
        
        $ apt-get install xsel gnupg2
        
        Installing via pip3
        --------------------
        
        You can install this package from the Python Package Index (pyPI) by running:
        
        * ``pip3 install pwclip``
        
        Installing from a source distribution archive
        ---------------------------------------------
        To install this package from a source distribution archive, do the following:
        
        1. Extract all the files in the distribution archive to some directory on your
           system.
        2. In that directory, run: ``python setup.py install``
        
        
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Although is was planed as GUI-Program it's also possible to be executed from
        terminals. For Windows, Linux and OSX there is an appropriate executable
        packed which might be executed like the following examples will show:
        
        Yubikey-Mode
        ------------
        ``pwclip``
        
        The PWCLIPTIME environment variable is used if found so the following command
        does pretty much the same:
        
        ``pwclip $PWCLIPTIME``
        
        To have it wait for a specific time like 5 seconds (bevore resetting the paste
        buffer to the previously copied value) use the following command:
        
        ``pwclip 5``
        
        GPG-Mode
        --------
        ``pwclip -c``
        
        Alike in yubikey-mode the PWCLIPTIME variable is used as timer. If there is an
        environment variable called GPGKEYS it will use those keys to encrypt on
        changes to the password file
