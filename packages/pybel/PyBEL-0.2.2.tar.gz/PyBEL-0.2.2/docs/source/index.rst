PyBEL Documentation
===================

Biological Expression Language (BEL) is a domain specific language that enables the expression of complex molecular relationships and their context in a machine-readable form. Its simple grammar and expressive power have led to its successful use in the IMI project, AETIONOMY, to describe complex disease networks with several thousands of relationships.

PyBEL is a Python software package that parses BEL statements, validates their semantics, applies common graph algorithms, and allows for data interchange with common formats like Neo4J, JSON, CSV, Excel, and SQL.

PyBEL provides a simple API so bioinformaticians and scientists with limited programming knowledge can easily use it to interface with BEL graphs, but is built on a rich framework that can be extended to develop new algorithms.
