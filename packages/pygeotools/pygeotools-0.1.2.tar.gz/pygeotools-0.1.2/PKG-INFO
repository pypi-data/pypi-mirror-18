Description: # pygeotools
        Libraries and utilities for geospatial data processing/analysis
        
        ## Overview
        
        ## Features
        - wrappers for raster to NumPy Masked Arrays
        - simple point coordinate transformations
        - automatic projection determination
        
        ### pygeotools/lib - libraries containing many useful functions
        - geolib - coordinate transformations, raster to vector, vector to raster
        - malib - NumPy Masked Array, DEMStack class
        - warplib - on-the-fly GDAL warp operations
        - iolib - file input/output, primarily wrappers for GDAL I/O
        - timelib - time conversions, useful when working with time series
        - filtlib - raster filtering operations
        - pltlib - some useful matplotlib plotting functions
        
        ### pygeotools/bin
        
        Useful Python and shell command-line utilities
        - warptool.py
        - ndvtrim.py
        - ...
        
        ## Examples 
        
        Warping multiple datasets to common grid and computing difference
        ```
        from pygeotools import iolib, warplib, malib
        fn1 = 'raster1.tif'
        fn2 = 'raster2.tif'
        ds_list = warplib.memwarp_multi_fn([fn1, fn2], res='max', extent='intersection', t_srs='first', r='cubic')
        r1 = iolib.ds_getma(ds_list[0])
        r2 = iolib.ds_getma(ds_list[1])
        rdiff = r1 - r2
        malib.print_stats(rdiff)
        out_fn = 'raster_diff.tif'
        iolib.writeGTiff(rdiff, out_fn, ds_list[0])
        ```
        or, from the command line `warptool.py -tr 'max' -te 'intersection' -t_srs 'first' raster1.tif raster2.tif`
        
        Creating a "stack" object (currently called DEMStack, but any raster will do):
        ```
        fn_list = ['20080101_dem.tif', '20090101_dem.tif', '20100101_dem.tif']
        s = malib.DEMStack(fn_list, res='min', extent='union')
        s.stack_std
        s.stack_trend
        ```
        or, from the command line `make_stack.py 20*.tif`
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Is in the works...
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install the latest release from PyPI:
        
            pip install pygeotools 
        
        ### Building from source
        
        Clone the repository and install:
        
            git clone https://github.com/dshean/pygeotools.git
            pip install pygeotools/
        
        ### Core requirements 
        - GDAL 
        - NumPy 
        
        ### Optional requirements (needed for some functionality) 
        - Matplotlib
        - SciPy
        - NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (Precompiled binaries and documentation available from https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/)
        
        ## Disclaimer 
        
        This originated as a poorly-written, poorly-organized personal repo that I am finally cleaning up and distributing.  There are some things that work very well, and other things that were hastily written for a one-off task several years ago.  
        
        This was all developed for Python 2.X, but will support Python 3.X in the near future.
