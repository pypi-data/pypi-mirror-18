        Pygerrit2 provides a simple interface for clients to interact with
        [Gerrit Code Review][gerrit] via the REST API.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        Pygerrit2 is compatible with Python 2.6 and Python 2.7.  Support for Python 3
        is experimental.
        
        Pygerrit2 depends on the [requests library][requests].
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install pygerrit2, simply:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install pygerrit2
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        This simple example shows how to get the user's open changes. Authentication
        to Gerrit is done via HTTP Digest authentication, using an explicitly given
        username and password:
        
        ```python
        from requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth
        from pygerrit2.rest import GerritRestAPI
        
        auth = HTTPDigestAuth('username', 'password')
        rest = GerritRestAPI(url='http://review.example.net', auth=auth)
        changes = rest.get("/changes/?q=owner:self%20status:open")
        ```
        
        Note that is is not necessary to add the `/a/` prefix on the endpoint
        URLs. This is automatically added when the API is instantiated with an
        authentication object.
        
        If the user's HTTP username and password are defined in the `.netrc`
        file:
        
        ```bash
        machine review.example.net login MyUsername password MyPassword
        ```
        
        then it is possible to authenticate with those credentials:
        
        ```python
        from pygerrit2.rest import GerritRestAPI
        from pygerrit2.rest.auth import HTTPDigestAuthFromNetrc
        
        url = 'http://review.example.net'
        auth = HTTPDigestAuthFromNetrc(url=url)
        rest = GerritRestAPI(url=url, auth=auth)
        changes = rest.get("/changes/?q=owner:self%20status:open")
        ```
        
        Note that the HTTP password is not the same as the SSH password. For
        instructions on how to obtain the HTTP password, refer to Gerrit's
        [HTTP upload settings documentation][settings].
        
        Refer to the [example script][example] for a full working example.
