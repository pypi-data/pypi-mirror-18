version 0.93.2
- labrad.decorators: BUGFIX: fix handling of LRNone in @setting decorator
- labrad.units:
    BUGFIX: comparison of WithUnit values with different units was broken due to default
        implementations of __le__, __lt__ etc. methods being called instead of overloaded
        __cmp__ method.  Provided explicit implementations of these methods that delegate
        to __cmp__ to convert to the correct units and perform the comparison.
        (reported by Michael Ramm)
    added gauss = 1e-4 T as an additional magnetic field unit (thanks Michael Ramm)
    added bohr_magneton = 9.2740096820e-24 * J/T (thanks Michael Ramm)

version 0.93.1
- labrad.types: BUGFIX: fixed problem with parsing empty type tags with comments
- labrad.units: changed stringification of units with only negative exponents.
    instead of 1/s, now gives s^-1; instead of 1/m/kg now gives m^-1*kg^-1.
    this is a workaround for a bug in the Delphi version of the registry (thanks Peter O'Malley).

version 0.93.0
- labrad.protocol; BUGFIX: fixed issue in LabradProtocol.removeListener (thanks Michael Ramm)
- refactored async code to make it easier to remove twisted dependency

version 0.92.7
- labrad.gpib: BUGFIX: added missing @inlineCallbacks annotations in GPIBDeviceWrapper methods

version 0.92.6
- labrad.node: added support for running servers as executable jar/war files by
    configuring the java path.  The jars can contain embedded metadata for the
    node server in a zipped node.ini file

version 0.92.5
- labrad.client: separated Client from Connection so that multiple Clients
    can share a single connection.  These clients can have separate contexts
    to allow for all requests made on that client to be in a different
    default context. 

- labrad.gpib: added the ability to optionally set a temporary timeout for each read/write/query operation
- labrad.gpib: fixed bug with DeviceLockedError exception type not being imported
