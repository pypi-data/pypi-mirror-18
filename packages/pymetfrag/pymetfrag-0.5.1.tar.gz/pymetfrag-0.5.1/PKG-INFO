Description: 
        
        This libraries wraps Metfrag_. It needs pandas installed and works nicely with emzed, though
        emzed is not mandatory.
        
        MetFrag_ is a freely available software for the annotaion of high precision
        tandem mass spectra of metabolites which is a first and critical step for the
        identification of a molecule's structure. Candidate molecules of different
        databases are fragmented in silico and matched against mass to charge values. A
        score calculated using the fragment peak matches gives hints to the quality of
        the candidate spectrum assignment.
