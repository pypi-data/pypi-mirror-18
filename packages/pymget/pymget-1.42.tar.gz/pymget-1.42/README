 -b block_size                  Specify the size of data block received from 
                                mirrors in each task. Default value is 4MB. 
 --block-size=block_size        Value could be in bytes, kilobytes or megabytes.
                                To specify units add symbol K or M.

 -T timeout                     Specify timeout for mirror response in seconds.
 --timeout=timeout              Default value is 10 seconds.

 -o filename                    Specify a name of the file data will be saved
 --out-file=filename            to. By default the filename on the server is
                                used. If it's impossible to detect the filename, 
                                'out' will be used.

 -u filename                    Specify the file with links on each line.
 --urls-file=filename           Links from this file will be added to links from
                                command line.

Links should start with protocol http://, https:// or ftp:// and should be
splitted with space. If there is argument specifing a file with links in command
line, then you may omit links in the command line.
