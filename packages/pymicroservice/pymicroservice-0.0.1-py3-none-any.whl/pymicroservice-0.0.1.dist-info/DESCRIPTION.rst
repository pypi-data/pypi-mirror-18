================================

Motivation
----------

In the past years, the microservice-based architecture became very popular in the computing field. 
Although this architecture grew more and more popular, there are a few tools that can help an
individual to build such systems. The current alternatives are using [nameko](https://github.com/nameko/nameko) 
or by building a web application that acts like a microservice. I started developing this framework in order
to provide a tool for creating and managing such systems with ease, and that are capable of being specialized in
a certain role, be it entity management, data storage or just computing.

Example basic usage
-------------------

I want to obtain a framework that will allow someone to develop a microservice in a manner similar to this
```python

	from pymicroservice.core.microservice import PyMicroService
    from pymicroservice.core.decorators import public_method, private_api_method
    
    
    class HelloWorldService(PyMicroService):
        name = "hello.world.service"
        host = "127.0.0.1"
        port = 5000
    
        def __init__(self):
            self._values = {}
            super(HelloWorldService, self).__init__()
    
        @public_method
        def say_hello(self, name):
            return "hello {}".format(name)
    
        @public_method
        def store_value(self, name, value):
            """
            Stores the value internally.
            """
            self._values[name] = value
            return "ok"
    
        @private_api_method
        def retrieve_value(self, name):
            """
            Retrieves a value that was previously stored.
            """
            return self._values[name]
    
        @public_method
        def more_stuff(self, x, y, k=3, *args, **kwargs):
            return "ok"
    
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        service = HelloWorldService()
        service.start()

```
