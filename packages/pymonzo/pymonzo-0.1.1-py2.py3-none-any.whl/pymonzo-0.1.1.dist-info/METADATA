pymonzo
=======

|PyPI version| |Python versions| |License|

|Build status| |Test coverage|

Python library that nicely wraps `Monzo <https://monzo.com/>`__ public
API and allows you to use it directly from your Python project.

Installation
------------

>From PyPI:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install pymonzo

Usage
-----

To use the library you have to provide it with you Monzo access token.
You can either do that by exporting it as an environment variable
(``$ export MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"``) or by
passing it explicitly to ``MonzoAPI()`` class.

Roadmap
-------

The library currently does not implement feed items, webhooks and
attachments endpoints - I plan to add them in the future, but they
were't essential to my current needs and they could be completely
different in the future - per
`docs <https://monzo.com/docs/#introduction>`__: > The Monzo API is
under active development. Breaking changes should be expected.

I want to implement all API functionality as soon as it comes out of
beta and stabilizes.

The major addition I do want to add before that is better authentication
support - currently access tokens can be taken only from the `developer
playground <https://developers.getmondo.co.uk/api/playground>`__ and
work for just a couple of hours before expiring which is really
annoying. I chatted with Monzo devs in their Slack accout and currently
there's no way to get and regresh the access token for background only
applications (without OAuth authorization code grant and a website that
is).

API
---

There's no documentation as of now, but the code is commented and
*should* be pretty straightforward to use.

But feel free to ask me via
`email <mailto:pawel.adamczak@sidnet.info>`__ or `GitHub
issues <https://github.com/pawelad/pymonzo/issues/new>`__ if anything is
unclear.

Tests
-----

Package was tested with the help of ``py.test`` and ``tox`` on Python
2.7, 3.4 and 3.5 (see ``tox.ini``).

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variables with access
token before running ``tox`` inside the repository:

.. code:: shell

    $ export MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    $ tox
