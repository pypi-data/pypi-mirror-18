pynotebook
==========


Introduction
------------

Pynotebook is a an interactive shell for python, similar to the python
command line but much nicer to work with. Noteboks can contain python
code together with output and documentation. Nootebooks are a pleasent
way to develop python code and to document and store your ideas.

The "notebook" concept originally appeared with the program
Mathematica and became famous for python with the iPython/Jupyter
project. Unlike iPython, pynotebook does not need a webbrowser, c
extensions or anything except python and wx. Pynotebook runs out of
the box and therefore is easy to embed and distribute.

Most notable features of pynotebook are:

- syntax highlighting
- command completion (tab-key)
- builtin graphics
- matplotlib plotting
- BSD-license


Pynotebook can be used as stand alone application (pynb) or as a
library in wx programs.

There are a couple of demo applications:
- the pynb application 
- a plotting demo
- a notebook interface to gnu r

The later demonstrates how to completely modify the notebook. It uses
rpy2 for interfacing gnu r and pygments for colorization.


Installation:
------------

Do in a console:
        python ./setup.py build

and then as root:
        python ./setup.py install

This will install the pynb application and the pynotebook module. 

To open a notebook:
        pynb demo/ball.pyb
