pynotebook
==========


Introduction
------------

Pynotebook is a an interactive shell for python, similar to the python
command line but much nicer to work with. Notebooks can contain python
code together with output and documentation. Nootebooks are a pleasent
way to develop python code and to document and store your ideas.

The "notebook" concept originally appeared with the program
Mathematica and became famous for python with the `iPython/Jupyter <http://ipython.org>`_
project. Unlike iPython, pynotebook does not
need a webbrowser, c extensions or anything except python and
`wxPython <https://wxpython.org/>`_ . Pynotebook runs out of the box
and is therefore easy to embed and distribute.

Most notable features of pynotebook are:

- syntax highlighting
- command completion (tab-key)
- builtin graphics
- plotting via matplotlib
- BSD-license


Pynotebook can be used as stand alone application (pynb) or as a
widget in wx programs.

There are a couple of demo applications:

- the pynb application 
- a plotting demo
- a notebook interface to `Gnu R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_


The later demonstrates how to completely modify the notebook. It uses
`rpy2 <http://rpy2.bitbucket.org/>`_ for interfacing Gnu R and
Pygments `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_ for colorization.

This will install the pynb application and the pynotebook module. 

To open a notebook:
