# pyphs

The python package 'pyphs' provides a set of methods for the automated modelisation and generation of simulation code for passive multiphysical systems. It is built on the 'Port-Hamiltonian Systems' paradygm that structures physical systems into energy conserving, power dissipating and source parts.


This is encoded in the structure of the 'pyphs.PortHamiltonianSystem' object.
