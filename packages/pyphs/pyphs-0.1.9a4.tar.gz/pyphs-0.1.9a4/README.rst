Objectives
-----------
The python package **pyphs** is dedicated to the treatement of **passive multiphysical systems** in the **Port-Hamiltonian Systems** formalism which structures physical systems into 
   * energy conserving parts, 
   * power dissipating parts and 
   * source parts.
This guarantees a **power balance** is fullfilled, including for numerical **simulations** based on an adapted **numerical method**.   
   1. Systems are described by **directed multi-graphs** (``networkx.MultiDiGraph``).
   2. The time-continuous port-Hamiltonian structure is build from an **automated graph analysis**.
   3. The discrete-time port-Hamiltonian structure is derived from a **structure preserving numerical method**.
   4. **LaTeX** description code and **C++** simulation code are automatically generated.

``pip install pyphs``
An installation for *Anaconda* users **on Mac OSX** is also available:
``conda install -c afalaize pyphs``
