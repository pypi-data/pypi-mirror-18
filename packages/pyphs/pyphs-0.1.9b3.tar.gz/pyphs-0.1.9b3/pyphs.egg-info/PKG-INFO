Description: ======
        pyphs
        ======
        
        The python package **pyphs** is dedicated to the treatment of passive multiphy- sical systems in the Port-Hamiltonian Systems (PHS) formalism.
        This formalism structures physical systems into
        — energy conserving parts,
        — power dissipating parts and
        — source parts.
        This guarantees a power balance is fulfilled, including for numerical simulations based on an adapted numerical method.
        
        1. Systems are described by directed multi-graphs (networkx.MultiDiGraph).
        2. The time-continuous port-Hamiltonian structure is build from an automated graph analysis.
        3. The discrete-time port-Hamiltonian structure is derived from a structure preserving numerical method.
        4. **LaTeX** description code and **C++** simulation code are automatically generated.

        Installation
        --------------
        It is recommanded to install **pyphs** using pip. In terminal:
        ``pip install pyphs``
        An installation for *Anaconda* users **on Mac OSX** is also available (can be temporarily outdated, prefer pip install):
        ``conda install -c afalaize pyphs``
