pyradau13 - Python wrapper around the Hairer/Wanner implementation of RADAU13

RADAU13 is an implicit 13th order adaptive Runge-Kutta implementation by Ernst
Hairer and Gerhard Wanner. The Fortran code is available from Ernst Hairer's
website (http://www.unige.ch/~hairer/software.html) and a detailled
description is available in their book

Hairer, Norsett and Wanner (1993): Solving Ordinary Differential Equations.
Nonstiff Problems.  2nd edition. Springer Series in Comput. Math., vol. 8.

This package does not use f2py, but instead calls the fortran function from a C
extension. Dense output is available. Supplying a Jacobian function is
not (yet).
