Description: RADAU13 is an implicit 13th order adaptive Runge-Kutta implementation of the
        RADAU IIA method by Ernst Hairer and Gerhard Wanner. The Fortran code is
        available from Ernst Hairer's website
        
         http://www.unige.ch/~hairer/software.html
        
        and a detailled description is available in their book
        
        Hairer, Norsett and Wanner (1993): Solving Ordinary Differential Equations.
        Nonstiff Problems.  2nd edition. Springer Series in Comput. Math., vol. 8.
        
        This package does not use f2py, but instead calls the fortran function from a C
        extension. The solver features dense/continous output, support for implicit
        problems with a mass matrix, DAEs up to index 3 and multiple error control
        algorithms. The python interface includes all features except band-width
        control (for now), but some of the advanced/complex settings are not
        documented (yet).
