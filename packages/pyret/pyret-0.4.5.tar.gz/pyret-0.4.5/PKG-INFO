Description: 
                  The pyret package contains tools for analyzing neural
                  data. In particular, it contains methods for manipulating
                  spike trains (such as binning and smoothing), computing
                  spike-triggered averages and ensembles, computing nonlinearities,
                  as well as a suite of visualization tools.
