"""This module contains functions for RETIS.

This module defines functions that are needed to perform Replica
Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS). The algorithms
implemented here and the description of RETIS was first described by
van Erp [RETIS]_.


Important methods defined here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

make_retis_step
    Function to select and execute the RETIS move.

retis_tis_moves
    Function to execute the TIS steps in the RETIS algorithm.

retis_moves
    Function to perform RETIS swapping moves - it selects what scheme
    to use, i.e. ``[0^-] <-> [0^+], [1^+] <-> [2^+], ...`` or
    ``[0^+] <-> [1^+], [2^+] <-> [3^+], ...``.

retis_swap
    The function that actually swaps two path ensembles.

retis_swap_zero
    The function that performs the swapping for the
    ``[0^-] <-> [0^+]`` swap.

    """Determine and execute the appropriate RETIS move.

    Here we will determine what kind of RETIS moves we should do.
    We have two options:

    1) Do the RETIS swapping moves. This is done by calling
       `retis_move`
    2) Do TIS moves, either for all ensembles or for just one, based on
       values of relative shoot frequencies. This is done by calling
       `make_retis_tis_steps`.

    This function will just determine and execute the appropriate move
    (1 or 2) based on the given swapping frequencies in the `settings`
    and drawing a random number from the random number generator `rgen`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ensembles : list of objects like `PathEnsemble` from `.path`
        This is a list of the ensembles we are using in the RETIS method

    rgen : object like `RandomGenerator` from `.random_gen`.
        This is a random generator. Here we assume that we can call
        `rgen.rand()` to draw random uniform numbers.
    settings : dict
        This dict contains the settings for the RETIS method.
    cycle : integer

    Returns
    -------
    out : list of lists
        `out[i]` contains the result after performing the move for path
        ensemble no. `i`.

    This function will execute the TIS steps in the RETIS method. These

    on how to perform them. These two options are controlled by the
    given `settings`:

    1) If `relative_shoots` is given in the input settings, then we will
       pick at random what ensemble we will perform TIS on. For all the
       other ensembles we again have two options based on the given
       `settings['nullmoves']`:

       a) Do a 'null move' in all other ensembles.
       b) Do nothing for all other ensembles.

       Performing the null move in an ensemble will simply just accept
       the previously accepted path in that ensemble again.

    The retis swapping move for ensembles [0^-] and [0^+] requires some
    extra integration. Here we are generating new paths for [0^-] and
    [0^+] in the following way:

    1) For [0^-] we take the initial point in [0^+] and integrate
       backward in time. This is merged with the second point in [0^+]
       to give the final path. The initial point in [0^+] starts to the
       left of the interface and the second point is on the right
       side - i.e. the path will cross the interface at the end points.
       If we let the last point in [0^+] be called ``A_0`` and the
       second last point ``B``, and we let ``A_1, A_2, ...`` be the
       points on the backward trajectory generated from ``A_0`` then

       ``[..., A_2, A_1, A_0, B]``. Here, ``B`` will be on the right
       side of the interface and the first point of the path will also
       be on the right side.

    2) For [0^+] we take the last point of [0^-] and use that as an
       initial point to generate a new trajectory for [0^+] by
       integration forward in time. We also include the second last
       point of the [0^-] trajectory which is on the left side of the
       interface. We let the second last point be ``B`` (this is on the
       left side of the interface), the last point ``A_0`` and the
       points generated from ``A_0`` we denote by ``A_1, A_2, ...``.
       Then the resulting path will be ``[B, A_0, A_1, A_2, ...]``.
