"""This package defines different simulations for use with pyretis.

The different simulations are defined as objects which inherits from
the base Simulation object defined in `simulation.py`. The simulation
object defines as simulation as a series of tasks to be executed,
typically at each step of the simulation. Output is handled with a
different set out 'output' tasks which make use of the results obtained
in the simulation steps.

Package structure
