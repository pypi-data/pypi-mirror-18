"""This file contains functions used in TIS.

This module defines the functions needed to perform TIS simulations.
The algorithms are implemented as described by van Erp et al. [TIS]_.

Important methods defined here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

make_tis_step
    Function that will perform a single TIS step.

    convenient for the following usage in the

    This method will modify the velocities of a time slice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : object like `System` from `.system`.
        System is used here since we need access to the particle
        list.
    rgen : object like `RandomGenerator` from `.random_gen`.
        This is the random generator that will be used.
    sigma_v : numpy.array
        These values can be used to set a standard deviation (one for
        each particle) for the generated velocities.
    aimless : boolean, optional
        Determines if we should do aimless shooting or not.
    momentum : boolean, optional
        If True, we reset the linear momentum to zero after kicking.
    rescale : float, optional
        For some NVE simulations, we can rescale the energy to a fixed
        value. If `rescale` is a float > 0, we will rescale the energy (after
        modification of the velocities) to match the given float.

    integrator : object like `Integrator` from `.integrators`.
        This is the propagator of the simulation
    rgen : object like `RandomGenerator` from `.random_gen`.
        This is the random generator that will be used.
    tis_settings : dict
        Settings for TIS method, here we explicitly use:

        * `start_cond`: string which defines the start condition.

          length.

        Note that we here explicitly set some local TIS settings for
        use in the `make_tis_step` function.
