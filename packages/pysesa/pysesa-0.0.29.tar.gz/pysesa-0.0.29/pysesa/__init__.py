PySESA - a Python framework for Spatially Explicit Spectral Analysis

PySESA is an open-source project dedicated to provide a generic Python framework
for spatially explicit statistical analyses of point clouds and other geospatial data,
in the spatial and frequency domains, for use in the geosciences

The program is detailed in:
   Buscombe, D. (2016) "Computational considerations for spatially explicit spectral analysis of point clouds and geospatial data", 86, 92-108, 10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.004.
