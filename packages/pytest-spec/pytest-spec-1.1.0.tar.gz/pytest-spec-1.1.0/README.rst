pytest-spec
===========
pytest plugin to display test execution output like a SPECIFICATION.


Available features
==================
* Format output to look like specification.
* Group tests by classes and files
* Failed, passed and skipped are marked and colored.
* Remove test\_ and underscores for every test.


Output example
==============

::

    py.test --spec

    test/test_results/test_as_class.py::TestResults
        [SKIP]  Some method return none
        [FAIL]  Some method returns false
        [PASS]  Some method returns true

    test/test_results/test_as_functions.py
        [PASS]  Some method returns true
        [FAIL]  Some method returns false
        [SKIP]  Some method return none


Configuration
=============

``spec_header_format``
----------------------

You can configure the format of the test headers by specifying a `format string <https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax>`_ in your `ini-file <http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/customize.html#inifiles>`_:

::

    [pytest]
    spec_header_format = {path}:{class_name}

In addition to the ``{path}`` and ``{class_name}`` replacement fields, there is also ``{test_case}`` that holds a more human readable name.

``spec_test_format``
--------------------

You can configure the format of the test results by specifying a `format string <https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax>`_ in your `ini-file <http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/customize.html#inifiles>`_:

::

    [pytest]
    spec_test_format = [{result}]  {name}
