It has been shown that the use of Trace in Testmon has a significant
performance hit with CPU intensive tests. For comparison,
TestMiner.test_target_5 takes about 10 seconds when invoked by standard
Python unittest runner as opposed to about 70 seconds when run by
Testmon.

IO intensive tests have shown no major slowdown when executed by Testmon.
