        License
        =======
        
        License is indicated in the project metadata (typically one or more
        of the Trove classifiers). For more details, see `this explanation
        <https://github.com/jaraco/skeleton/issues/1>`_.
        
        Docs
        ====
        
        There's `no good mechanism for publishing documentation
        <https://github.com/pypa/python-packaging-user-guide/pull/266>`_
        easily. If there's a documentation link above, it's probably
        stale because PyPI-based documentation is deprecated. This
        project may have documentation published at ReadTheDocs, but
        probably not. Good luck finding it.
