Description: # remedy
        
        Remedy is yet another translator from markdown to
        [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). It is very similar to other
        solutions to the same problem, but it allows for a bit more control over the
        resulting html document. Specifically, you can pipe in additional header code
        and thus include custom css and javascript. Furthermore, you can have
        individual slides be marked by certain keywords.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Should just be a simple
        
            pip install remedy
        
        Alternatively, you can run the `setup.py`.
        
        
        ## Simple example
        
        
        Imagine the following markdown script
        
            # My first remedy
        
            ---
        
            ## Remedy is no solution for everything
        
            - You might want to use reveal directly
            - there are other markdown to reveal.js converters
        
            ---html,subslide
        
            <div class='special-class'>
                Something is happening in here that's to complicated to express in markdown.
                Maybe something that requires elaborate styling or javascript?
            </div>
        
            ---subslide
        
            ## Another markdown slide
        
            We all know how to write markdown, right?
        
            ---
        
            ## Final slide
        
            Good bye!
        
        stored in `slides.md`. You can then use
        
            python -m remedy slides.md
        
        To create an html file called `presentation.html` that contains a slide show
        for your presentation.
        
        Maybe, we also have an additional bit of header code in a separate file
        `header_mod.html` that styles your `"special-class"`:
        
            <style>
            .special-class {
                font-size: 24pt !important;
            }
            </style>
        
        This can be included by simply calling
        
            python -m remedy --header=header_mod.html slides.md
        
        Try `python -m remedy -h` for more options.
        
        ## Contributing
        
        I believe that `remedy` is a pretty nice tool if you do so too, but you miss
        that one really neat feature. Code it yourself and send me a pull request. If
        you find a bug, ideally fix it yourself and send me a pull request.
        
        Note that there are tests. They should pass after you apply your changes. Also,
        I'm trying to stick to pep8 with respect to code formatting. You should do so
        as well.
