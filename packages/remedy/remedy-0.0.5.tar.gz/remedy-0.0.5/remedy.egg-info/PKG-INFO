Description: remedy
        ======
        
        Remedy is yet another translator from markdown to
        `reveal.js <http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/>`__. It is very similar to
        other solutions to the same problem, but it allows for a bit more
        control over the resulting html document. Specifically, you can pipe in
        additional header code and thus include custom css and javascript.
        Furthermore, you can have individual slides be marked by certain
        keywords.
        
        Note that remedy requires python3.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Should just be a simple
        
        ::
        
            pip install remedy
        
        Alternatively, you can run the ``setup.py``.
        
        Simple example
        --------------
        
        Imagine the following markdown script
        
        ::
        
            # My first remedy
        
            ---
        
            ## Remedy is no solution for everything
        
            - You might want to use reveal directly
            - there are other markdown to reveal.js converters
        
            ---html,subslide
        
            <div class='special-class'>
                Something is happening in here that's to complicated to express in markdown.
                Maybe something that requires elaborate styling or javascript?
            </div>
        
            ---subslide
        
            ## Another markdown slide
        
            We all know how to write markdown, right?
        
            ---
        
            ## Final slide
        
            Good bye!
        
        stored in ``slides.md``. You can then use
        
        ::
        
            python -m remedy slides.md
        
        To create an html file called ``presentation.html`` that contains a
        slide show for your presentation.
        
        Maybe, we also have an additional bit of header code in a separate file
        ``header_mod.html`` that styles your ``"special-class"``:
        
        ::
        
            <style>
            .special-class {
                font-size: 24pt !important;
            }
            </style>
        
        This can be included by simply calling
        
        ::
        
            python -m remedy --header=header_mod.html slides.md
        
        Try ``python -m remedy -h`` for more options.
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        I believe that ``remedy`` is a pretty nice tool if you do so too, but
        you miss that one really neat feature. Code it yourself and send me a
        pull request. If you find a bug, ideally fix it yourself and send me a
        pull request.
        
        Note that there are tests. They should pass after you apply your
        changes. Also, I'm trying to stick to pep8 with respect to code
        formatting. You should do so as well.
        
        Tests
