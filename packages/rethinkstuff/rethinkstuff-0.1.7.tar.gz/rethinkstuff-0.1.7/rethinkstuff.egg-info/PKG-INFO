        ============
        
        Rudimentary rethinkdb python library with some smarts (and maybe some
        dumbs)
        
        What? Why?
        ----------
        
        As of now there is a very small amount of code here. I had three
        projects using the Rethinker class, and had enough code churn inside the
        class that it became too painful to keep the three copies in sync. Thus,
        a library shared among them.
        
        Three main purposes: 
        
        - round-robin connections among database servers 
        - make sure connections close at proper time 
        - retry retry-able queries on failure
        
        Not really a connection pool, because it doesn’t keep any connections
        open, but it does take care of connection management.
        
        Service Registry
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Now also has a ServiceRegistry class, a lightweight solution for service
        discovery for distributed services. Maintains service info and status in
        a rethinkdb table called “services”.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            import rethinkstuff
            r = rethinkstuff.Rethinker(['db0.foo.com', 'db0.foo.com:38015', 'db1.foo.com'], 'my_db')
            r.table('my_table').insert({'foo':'bar','baz':2}).run()
            for result in r.table('my_table'):
                print("result={}".format(result))
