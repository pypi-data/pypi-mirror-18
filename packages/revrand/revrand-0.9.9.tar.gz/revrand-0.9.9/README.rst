A library of scalable Bayesian generalized linear models with *fancy* features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library implements various Bayesian linear models (Bayesian linear
regression) and generalized linear models. A few features of this library are:

- A fancy basis functions/feature composition framework for combining basis
  functions like radial basis functions, sigmoidal basis functions, polynomial
  basis functions etc *with basis function parameter learning*.
- Random Basis functions that can be used to approximate Gaussian processes
  with shift invariant covariance functions (e.g. Matern) when used with linear
  models [1]_, [2]_, [3]_.
- Non-Gaussian likelihoods with Bayesian generalized linear models (GLMs). We
  infer all of the parameters in the GLMs using auto-encoding variational
  Bayes [4]_, and we approximate the posterior over the weights with a mixture
  of Gaussians, like [5]_.
- Large scale learning using stochastic gradients (Adam, AdaDelta and more).
- Scikit Learn compatibility, i.e. usable with `pipelines
  <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html>`_.
- A host of decorators for `scipy.optimize.minimize
  <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html>`_ and stochastic 
  gradients that enhance the functionality of these optimisers.

Here is an example of approximating a Matern 3/2 kernel with some of our basis
functions,

here is an example of the algorithms in *revrand* approximating a Gaussian
Process,

and here is an example of running using our Bayesian GLM with a Poisson
likelihood and integer observations,

Have a look at some of the demo `notebooks <demos/>`_ for how we generated
these plots, and more!

Quickstart
----------

To install, simply run ``setup.py``:

.. code:: console

   $ python setup.py install

or install with ``pip``:

.. code:: console
