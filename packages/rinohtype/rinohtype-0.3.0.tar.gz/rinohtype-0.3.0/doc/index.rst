========================================

Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Release History <changelog>`)

Rinohtype is a high-level PDF library for Python. It helps automating the
creation of any type of document, ranging from invoices to long, complex
technical documents.

Paired with Sphinx_, rinohtype offers a modern alternative to LaTeX_ . Sphinx
helps writing large structured documents and supports a multitude of different
output formats including searchable HTML. Rinohtype provides a Sphinx backend
that allows generating professionally typeset PDF documents.
