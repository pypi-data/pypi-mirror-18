        A framework for learning about and experimenting with reinforcement learning algorithms.
        It is built on top of TensorFlow and `TFLearn <http://tflearn.org/>`_  and is interfaces
        with the OpenAI gym (universe should work, too). It aims to be as modular as possible so
        that new algorithms and ideas can easily be tested. I started it to gain a better
        understanding of core RL algorithms and maybe it can be useful for others as well.
