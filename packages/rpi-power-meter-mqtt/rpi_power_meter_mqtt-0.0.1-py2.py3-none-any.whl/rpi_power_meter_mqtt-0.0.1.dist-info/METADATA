Description: Power Meter Logger for Raspberry Pi
        =============================
        
        Reads the led impulses of a power meter via light sensor, calculate the current power consumption and sends it to a mqtt broker.
        
        
        Installation:
        -------------------
        
            pip install rpi-power-meter-mqtt
        
        Configuration:
        -------------------
        
        Needs a json configuration file as follows (don't forget to change ip's and credentials ;-)):
        
        .. code:: json
        
            {
                "mqtt_client_id": "power_meter",
                "mqtt_host": "192.168.0.210",
                "mqtt_port": "1883",
                "sources": [
                    {
                      "gpio": "4",
                      "topic": "halti/david/power_consumption"
                    },
                    {
                      "gpio": "17",
                      "topic": "halti/stweg/power_consumption"
                    }
                  ]
            }
        
        
        
        Start:
