Description: scanf: A small scanf implementation for python
        ==============================================
        
        Python has powerful regular expressions but sometimes they are totally
        overkill when you just want to parse a simple-formatted string. C
        programmers use the scanf function for these tasks (see link below).
        
        This implementation of scanf translates the simple scanf-format into
        regular expressions. Unlike C you can be sure that there are no buffer
        overflows possible.
        
        Usage
        -------------
        scanf supports the following formats:
          %c        One character
          %5c       5 characters
          %d, %i    int value
          %7d, %7i  int value with length 7
          %f        float value
          %o        octal value
          %X, %x    hex value
          %s        string terminated by whitespace
        
        Examples:
        >>> scanf("%s - %d errors, %d warnings", "/usr/sbin/sendmail - 0 errors, 4 warnings")
        ('/usr/sbin/sendmail', 0, 4)
        >>> scanf("%o %x %d", "0123 0x123 123")
        (66, 291, 123)
        
        
        scanf returns a tuple of found values, or None if the format does not match.

        Original code from:

        Modified original to make the %f more robust, as well as added %*
        modifier to skip fields.
        
        Releases
        --------
        
        1.0: 2010-10-11
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Initial release (internal)
        
        1.1: 2010-10-13
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Changed regex from 'match' (only matches at beginning of line) to
          'search' (matches anywhere in line)
        - Bugfix - ignore cast for skipped fields
        
        1.2: 2013-05-30
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added 'collapseWhitespace' flag (defaults to True) to take the search
          string and replace all whitespace with regex string to match repeated
          whitespace. This enables better matching in log files where the data
          has been formatted for easier reading. These cases have variable
          amounts of whitespace between the columns, depending on the number of
          characters in the data itself.
        
        1.3: 2016-01-18
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added 'extractdata' function.
        
        1.3.1 - 1.3.3: 2016-06-23
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Initial release to PyPI
        - Fixed various issues with metadata for PyPI
        
        1.4: 2016-12-03
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Small modification to scanf.py for Python3 compatibility. Thanks @Gattocrucco!
        - Changed README.md to README.rst, removing pypandoc dependency in setup.py
        - Removed most of the comments at the beginning of scanf.py, as they were
          redundant with those in the README.
