Description: SciExp² (aka *SciExp square* or simply *SciExp2*) stands for *Scientific
        Experiment Exploration*, which provides a framework for easing the workflow of
        creating, executing and evaluating experiments. The driving idea is that of
        quick and effortless *design-space exploration*.
        
        Experiments can be defined as a permutation of different parameters in the
        design space. It creates the necessary files to run these experiments
        (configuration files, scripts, etc.), which you define as templates that get
        substituted with the specific parameter values of each experiment.
        
        SciExp2 also provides tools to run these experiments on different execution
        platforms like regular local scripts or a cluster jobs. It takes care of
        tracking their correct execution, and allows subsetting which experiments to run
        (e.g., those with specific parameter values, or those that were not successfully
        run yet).
        
        Finally, SciExp2 provides functions to collect and analyze the results of the
        experiments. Results are automatically collected into a data
        structure that maintains the relationship between each result and the
        parameters of the experiment that produced it. With this you can effortlessly
        perform complex tasks such as inspecting the results or calculating statistics
        of experiments sub-sets, based on their parameter values.
