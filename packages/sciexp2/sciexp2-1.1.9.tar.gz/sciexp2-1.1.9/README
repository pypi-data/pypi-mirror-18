SciExp²
=======

SciExp² (aka *SciExp square* or simply *SciExp2*) stands for *Scientific
Experiment Exploration*, which contains a comprehensive framework for easing the
workflow of creating, executing and evaluating experiments.

The driving idea behind the provided abstractions is that of the need for quick
and effortless *design-space exploration*. That is, the definition and
evaluation of experiments that are based on the permutation of different
parameters in the design space.

The framework is available in the form of Python modules which can be integrated
into your own applications, but also comes with some interfaces to allow for
quick writing without having to import a whole set of modules and instantiate
objects of their corresponding classes.
