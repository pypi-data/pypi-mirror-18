Once ready for prime time, the major version number will jump to 2 to reflect that this is actually the second incarnation of Scripnix.

## Installation

On macOS, Homebrew will take care of installing any dependencies, including Python 3.

    brew tap yukondude/tap
    brew install scripnix
    install-scripnix
    
### PyPI (POSIX)

On *NIX, you will first need to install Python 3.3 (or higher) using your preferred method.

    pip3 install scripnix
    install-scripnix
    
## Development Setup

 1. Install Scripnix, as above, so that all of its dependencies are available.
 1. Create a Python 3 virtualenv for Scripnix.
 1. Clone the Scripnix repo.

 1. Install the project in development mode: `./setup.py develop`
 1. Run the unit tests to make sure everything is copacetic: `./setup.py test`
 1. Pour a snifter of Martell XO and light up a Bolivar Belicoso.
