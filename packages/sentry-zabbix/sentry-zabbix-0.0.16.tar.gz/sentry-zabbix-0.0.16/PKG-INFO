Description: sentry-zabbix
        =============
        
        An extension for Sentry to send event counts to Zabbix; shamelessly based on sentry-statsd_.
        This will send keys formatted like ``<prefix>.<level>[<project>]`` (e.g. 
        ``sentry.error[my-thing]``), which will need to be configured as items in Zabbix.
        
        If you run a Sentry version older than 8, use sentry-zabbix <=0.0.13
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Install the package with ``pip``::
        
            pip install sentry-zabbix
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Go to your project's configuration page (Projects -> [Project]) and select the
        "Zabbix" tab. Enter the Zabbix host, port and prefix for metrics:

        After installing and configuring, make sure to restart sentry-worker and sentry-web for the
        changes to take effect.
