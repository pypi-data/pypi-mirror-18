smop -- matlab to python compiler

Installation with easy_install
==============================

This is the preferred option, because easy_install takes care of
everything -- finding the dowinload site, and installing the dependences
(numpy and networkx).  If you don't have easy_install, this is the
perfect time to install it.  It is a part of setuptools package located
at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools.

$ easy_install smop

Binary Windows installer
========================

Download it from github then run it, but you must make sure you have
installed the dependences -- numpy and networkx.

Installation from sources 
=========================

1. Clone git repository

   git clone https://github.com/victorlei/smop.git
   
2. Install the dependences.  This was tested on ubuntu and linuxmint

   sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-ply python-numpy python-scipy

3. Run the install script

   sudo python setup.py install [--user]

your .local/bin into the search path (unix only).
