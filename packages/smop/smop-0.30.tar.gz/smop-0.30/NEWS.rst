    Version 0.29 is out

    Test suite for regression testing is ready,
        with about 1000 m-scripts.  Scripts are translated
        to python, then the resulting py-files are loaded,
        but not yet run.

    Version 0.28 is out. 

    Line numbering information is included in the output.
        Enabled by default.  Disabled with ``--no-numbers``.

    Block comments are preserved now.
        Lines, containing anything but a comment, are
        preserved. Enabled by default.
        Disabled with ``--no-comments``.

    New command-line options
        ``--no-resolve,--no-backend`` useful mostly for
        debugging. New shortcuts -R -B -T -C -N
        
    Special ``%!`` comments are partially supported now.
        They are mostly useful in testing, and
        are used by Octave library and test suite. Disabled
        by default. Enabled with ``--testing-mode``.

   After a year-long vacation I am back to active development.
   My first goal is adopting the Octave runtime and test suite.

   Downloaded ``mybench`` -- a collection of 20 or so
   micro-benchmarks originally meant to compare matlab and
   octave performance.  After succesfully running the first nine,
   the geometric mean of the speedup is 0.36,  which is cool.

   Version 0.26.3 is available for beta testing.
   Next version 0.27 is planned to compile octave
   ``scripts`` library, which contains over 120 KLOC in
   almost 1,000 matlab files. There  are 13 compilation
   errors with smop 0.26.3 .
