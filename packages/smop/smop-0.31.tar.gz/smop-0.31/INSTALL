smop -- matlab to python compiler

Installation with pip
=====================

Install pip

    sudo apt-get install python-pip

Install smop

    pip install smop --user

or

    sudo pip install smop

Done.

Installation with easy_install
==============================

This is the preferred option, because easy_install takes care of
everything -- finding the dowinload site, and installing the
dependences.  If you don't have easy_install, this is the perfect time
to install it.  It is a part of setuptools package, so for linux users

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

For other operating systems, see

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

Now create directory ~/.local/bin and make sure it is in your path.
Install smop:

    easy_install --user smop

Alternatively, install as root

    sudo easy_install smop

Installing the dependences
==========================

From time to time, one of the projects that we depend on, fails to
install using easy_install (as of Nov 6, 2016 scipy). Don't panic.
Manually install whatever projects are missing.

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-ply python-numpy python-scipy

Binary Windows installer
========================

Download it from github then run it, but you must make sure you have
installed the dependences.

Installation from sources 
=========================

1. Clone git repository

   git clone https://github.com/victorlei/smop.git
   
2. Install the dependences.  This was tested on ubuntu and linuxmint

   sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-ply python-numpy python-scipy

3. Run the install script

   sudo python setup.py install [--user]

your .local/bin into the search path (unix only).
