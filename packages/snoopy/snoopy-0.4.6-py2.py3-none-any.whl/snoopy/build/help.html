Batch Mode
In this mode, you have several sets of sequence files, each with their own set of variants. A common use case may be wanting to view called variants in trios (mother, father, child). For example:

chr1:100
chr2:200
/path/to/mother01.bam
/path/to/father01.bam
/path/to/child01.bam

chr3:300
chr4:400
/path/to/mother02.bam
/path/to/father02.bam
/path/to/child02.bam
