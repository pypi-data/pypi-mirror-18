Description: 
        SOMECODE is a research platform for serious observation and analysis 
        of Twitter data. SOMECODE brings together 9 years of unbroken continuity 
        in developing social media research tools. Previous tools and processes 
        developed by the contributor team are in daily use by many FORTUNE100 
        companies and major advertising agencies. SOMECODE is the solution we 
        always wanted to build, but due to the kinds of restraints commercial 
        entities have, never got to.
