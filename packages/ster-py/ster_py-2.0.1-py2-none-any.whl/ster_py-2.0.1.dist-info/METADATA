Sidenote
~~~~~~~~

This is kind of weird. The only reason it exists is because sterkinekor
have generously(?) left all their [STRIKEOUT:xml] Json feeds open. The
ones I used in particular are:

::

     https://movies.sterkinekor.co.za/Browsing/QuickTickets/Cinemas
     https://movies.sterkinekor.co.za/Browsing/QuickTickets/Sessions
     https://movies.sterkinekor.co.za/Browsing/QuickTickets/Types
     https://movies.sterkinekor.co.za/Browsing/QuickTickets/Movies

I suppose I might as well show the parameters each accepts:

**POST /QuickTickets/Cinemas**

::

    Cookie : visSelectedSiteGroup = province_id

**POST /QuickTickets/Sessions**

::

    Showtypes: show_type
    Cinemas: cinema_id
    Movies: movie_id

Â **POST /QuickTickets/Types**

::

    Cinemas: cinema_id  
    Movies: movie_id  
    Date: YY/MM/DD 0:0:0 [OPTIONAL]

**POST /QuickTickets/Movies**

::

    Cinemas: cinema_id

Indeed, it seems possible this could be written into a python wrapper of
some sort.

Anyway, because sk is not using xml feeds anymore and they seem to be in
the process of rebuilding their site; the script now takes way longer to
run. I'm not sure if this is because their servers are slow or I'm
making way too many api calls. You tell me. In any case it takes about
10-15 seconds to receive the list of movies.

Because the website is so unstable and the api is mostly half baked, the
updated ster-py has a lot of seemingly unnecessary functions. That would
hopefully be unneeded, if the api worked as it seems to be setup to.

It's pretty cool that all of this data is available. So I thought I
might as well take advantage of that; especially because of how much I
*kind of...* hate their website :)

Also this is the first time I've ever released a python package on PyPi
so if I've made any obvious mistakes, well anywhere, please tell me!
