Description: 
        		Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and so 
        		called "likelihood free" Markov chain Monte Carlo 
        		techniques are popular methods for tackling parameter 
        		inference in scenarios where the likelihood is intractable or unknown. 
        		These methods are called likelihood free as they are free from 
        		the usual assumptions about the form of the likelihood e.g. Gaussian, 
        		as ABC aims to simulate samples from the parameter posterior distribution directly.
        		``superABC`` is a python package that implements  the astroABC sampler using either the SNANA or the sncosmo Supernovae simulation
        		packages and simulates samples from the posterior distribution using two distinct distance metrics.
        		``superABC`` requires ``NumPy``,``SciPy`` and ``astroabc``. The SNANA and rootpy packages are required if using this as a forward model simulation.
        		sncosmo, astropy and pandas are required if using sncosmo as the forward model simulation.
