Supplychainpy is a Python library for supply chain analysis, modeling and simulation. The library is currently in early stages of development, so not ready for use in production. For quick exploration, please see the **Quick Guide** below.

Changelog
=========

0.0.4
^^^^^
Release 0.0.4 has breaking API changes. Namespaces have changed in this release. All the modules previously in the
"demand" package are now inside the "inventory" package. If you have been using the "model_inventory" module, then nothing has
changed, and there will not be any break in contracts.


Application
-----------

-   [Update] Explicit internal and public API.
-   [Update] Excess, shortages added to the UncertainDemand order_summary.
-   [Update] Moved abc_xyz.py, analyse_uncertain_demand.py, economic_order_quantity.py and eoq.pyx from "demand" to "inventory" package
-   [Update] "Demand" package now contains: evolutionary_algorithms.py, forecast_demand.py and regression.py
-   [Update] retail_price added to `model_inventory.analyse_orders`.
-   [Update] backlog added to the data format for loading into the analysis.
-   [Update] Unit Tests.
-   [Update] Docstrings.
-   [New Feature] Analytic Hierarchy Process.
-   [New Feature] API supports Pandas `DataFrame`.
-   [New Feature] Browser based reporting suite, with charts, data summaries and integrated chat bot.
-   [New Feature] Dash Bot, a basic chat bot assistant for the data in the reporting suite. Query data using natural language.
-   [New Feature] Command line interface for processing .csv to database, launching reports and chat bot.
-   [New Feature] "Model_Demand" module containing simple exponential smoothing and holts trend corrected exponential smoothing.
-   [New Feature] Summarise and filter your analysis.
-   [New Feature] Holts Trend Corrected Exponential Smoothing Forecast and optimised variant (evolutionary algorithm for optimised alpha and gamma)
-   [New Feature] Simple Exponential Smoothing (evolutionary algorithm for optimised alpha).
-   [New Feature] Evolutionary Algorithms for Smoothing Level Constants (converges on better smoothing levels using genetic algorithm)
-   [New Feature] SKU and inventory profile recommendations generator.

Documentation
----------------

-   [New] Reporting Suite Walk Through.
-   [Update] Tutorial.
