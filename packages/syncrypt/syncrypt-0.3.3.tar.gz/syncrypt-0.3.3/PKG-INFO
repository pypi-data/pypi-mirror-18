Description: # Syncrypt client
        
        Syncrypt is a fully encrypted file storage service for groups and private
        backups. This is the client that you can use to store and retrieve files.
        The client will also do all encryption.
        
        The source code for this client is released under the GNU General Public License
        Version 3. For more information have a look at the `LICENSE` file in this
        directory. Additional information on the GNU GPLv3 can be found here:

        ## Installation
        
        Option 1: Install from PyPI (requires Python 3)
        
            pip install syncrypt
        
        This requires the ``snappy-c`` library in order to build the
        [python-snappy](https://github.com/andrix/python-snappy) dependency. In Ubuntu,
        you can install it with the APT package ``libsnappy-dev``. In OS X, you can
        install it with ```brew install snappy```.
        
        Option 2: Download one of the packages on our [releases page](https://alpha.syncrypt.space/releases/).
        
        Option 3: Install latest development version from source:
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/syncrypt/client
        
        ## Let's get started
        
        The ``syncrypt`` executable is the command line interface for Syncrypt. You
        can login to syncrypt so that you won't have to enter your login for every
        command you issue.
        
            syncrypt login
        
        This will ask for the email and the password of your Syncrypt account. If you
        do not have an account yet, please [sign up](https://syncrypt.space/) for our
        closed alpha mailing list and we will send you an invite.
        
        You can now initialize an arbitary directory as a vault. Simply change into
        this directory using ``cd`` and call:
        
            syncrypt init
        
        After you've set up the directory, you can push all of its contents by typing:
        
            syncrypt push
        
        For an extensive description of syncrypt commands, please see the [client
        manual](docs/manual.md).
