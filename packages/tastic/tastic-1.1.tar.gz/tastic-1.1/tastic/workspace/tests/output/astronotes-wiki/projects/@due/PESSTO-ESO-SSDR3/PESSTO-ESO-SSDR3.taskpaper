	Non-PESSTO Classified Sources: @wait
		- same task as for PESSTO classified sources
		- check all atel text for source where TRANS CLASS SOURCE =atel to make sure the classification has come from that atel
	ATel Matching: @due
		- read through all Atels and make sure 
			- the best classification is given
			- the best phase estimate is given (qualitative and quantitative)
	Host Matches: @flag
		- for each transient do the following staged searches until a host is found - remember to record spec redshift or photoz and the stage at which the host is found
			- 1.  NED Classified Extragalactic Source with 25" search radius
			- 2.  NED Unclassified Extragalactic Candidates with 25" search radius @due
			- 3.  SDSS DR12 Spectroscopic Sources with 25" search radius

Release Description:
New PhaseIII Changes:
	- Definition of catalogue data links. The keywords TXP3Ri and TXP3Ci, which were previously used to define the target catalogue of a data link between two catalogues, are being replaced by the new TXRGFi keyword. TXRGFi (type character string) should declare the filename of the target catalog in terms of the ORIGFILE name
