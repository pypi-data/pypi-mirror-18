- ASASSN14lp: the correct identifier for this ASASSN object should be ASASSN-14lp 
	- please modify the data (spectra and images)
	- re-upload
	- change the name also in the release description (as per R12).
- The STD fields you uploaded do not seem to qualify for Phase 3 publication
	- remove them from the release
	- remove them from the batch on FTP site
	- change the number of images detailed in the release description
- cross-check and make sure no spectrum has gone lost for the following objects (you have provided only images:)
	- MLS111022-000018+000321
	- SN1986G
- Scatter in (RA,DEC) of spectra .. The following 4 objects a spread higher than 3 arcsec has been found in the (RA,DEC) of their spectra. Please fix the spectral coordinates such that all spectra for a source always show the same RA,DEC.
	- [R4.1] ASASSN-14gm (about 8 arcsec)
	- [R4.2] ASASSN-14ha (up to more than 8 arcmin)
	- [R4.3] LSQ16ar (up to more than 7 hours in RA!)
	- [R4.4] PESSTOESO154-G10 ... scatter reaches more than 30 arcsec, might be SN2013fc or SN2014eg
- [R5] (RA,DEC) values in the header of the images ... the (RA,DEC) values of the images must report the position of the center of the field of view of the image.
	- can I regenerate Alberto s centre coordinate list with database information?
	- fix the headers with the correct (RA,DEC)
	- reupload images to batch
- [R6] MLS111022-000018+000321 wrong coordinates in the FITS card comment. Fix the following:
	- MLS111022-000018+000_20141114_H_merge_57621_1.fits OBJECT = 'MLS111022-000018+000321' / Original target. (this one is ok??)
	- MLS111022-000018+000_20141114_J_merge_57621_1.fits OBJECT = 'MLS111022-000018+000321' / Original target.
	- MLS111022-000018+000_20141114_Ks_merge_57621_1.fits OBJECT = 'MLS111022-000018+000321' / Original target
- [R7] MLS111022-000018+000321 WRONG PROCESSING? Images for OBJECT = 'MLS111022-000018+000' 
	- blinked images for MLS111022-000018+000321 one after the other and make gif
	- show that the easter part of the 3 images matches very well in all 3 files, while the western part of one image does not match the other two.
	- Work out what the issue is and send action to erkki
- Image quality: SN2013hx_20141229_Ks_merge_57621_1.fits shows a coaddition with wrong offsets
	- check the image and issues related to the image
	- determine next action
- [R9] Change the release description ... add a well visible comment stating that the new version of the catalogs will be provided soon.
- [R10] Typo in Release Content page 2: Please change from: "In total there are 2853 EFOSC2 spectra..." to: "In totale there are 2852 EFOSC2 spectra  
- Typo: In Table 3, please change OGLE-2012SN-006 with OGLE-2012-SN-006 (missing hyphen).
- Please change ASASSN14lp to the corrected ASASSN-14lp.
- please remove references to standard stars in the release description.
- Typo: In Table 4, please change the EFOSC2 number of 1d and 2d spectra from 2853 to 2852
