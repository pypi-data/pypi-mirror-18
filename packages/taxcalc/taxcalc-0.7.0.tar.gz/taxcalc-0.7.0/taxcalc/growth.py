    Constructor for economic growth adjustment class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    growth_dict: dictionary of PARAM:DESCRIPTION pairs
        dictionary of economic-growth parameters; if None, default
        parameters are read from the growth.json file.

    start_year: integer
        first calendar year for economic-growth parameters.

    num_years: integer
        number of calendar years for which to specify parameter
        values beginning with start_year.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError:
        if growth_dict is neither None nor a dictionary.
