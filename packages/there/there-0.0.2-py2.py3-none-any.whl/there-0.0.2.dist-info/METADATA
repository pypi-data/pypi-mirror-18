There
=====

Print the current filename and line.

Example, ``where.py``

.. code:: python

    import there
    import there as here

    print(here)
    print('and')
    print(there)

Then ``python where.py`` will print:

::

    where.py:4
    and
    where.py:6

That's it (for now), non more, no less. I have plan – the usually never
get realised – to also have a ``there.indent`` that return the
indentation of the current line.

Gotchas
=======

Returns the line where the ``__str__``, or ``__repr__`` of ``there`` is
computed. Usually by ``print``. So it might be wrong. If you want to be
sure (like when using ``log``) wrap it in ``str()``

Runs only on CPython likely. But anyway don't run it in production.
