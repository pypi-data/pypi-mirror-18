    """The wakeupTransportBase is designed to be used as a mixin-base for
       a Transport class and provides handling for the wakeupAfter()
       functionality.

       This base mixin provides the primary .run() entrypoint for the
       transport and a .run_time ExpiryTime member that provides the
       remaining time-to-run period.

       The system can handle .wakeupAfter() requests by calling this
       class's .addWakeup() method with the datetime.timedelta for the
       wakeup to be scheduled.

       The Transport should provide the following:

         ._runWithExpiry(incomingHandler)

              Called by this class's .run() entrypoint to do the
              actual transport-specific run routine.  Should perform
              that activity while the self.run_time ExpiryTime is not
              expired (self.run_time will be updated when new
              wakeupAfter() events are scheduled).
