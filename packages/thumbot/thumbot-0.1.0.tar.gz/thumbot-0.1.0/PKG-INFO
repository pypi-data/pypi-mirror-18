        ## Requirements
        - Python;
        - Your bot/channel must be created with [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI);
        - MongoDB;
        
        
        ## Running
        
        - Your're going to need to run an instance of [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). For tests porpuse (or even production, but with some concerns) you can use [Docker](https://docker.com/)  and get a container running in some minutes:
        
          `$ docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo`
        
        - To install Thumbot is pretty easy:
        
          `$ pip install thumbot`
        
        - Now, you're ready to include the Thumbot keyboard in your bot or channel!
        
        
        ## Usage
        ```py
        from thumbot import Thumbot
        
        # Create a new instance of Thumbot passing chat and message ids:
        thumbot = Thumbot(chat_id, message_id)
        
        # Now you can vote up and down with the methods .up() and .down(),
        # always passing the id of the user that is voting:
        thumbot.up(user_id)
        thumbot.down(user_id)
        ```
