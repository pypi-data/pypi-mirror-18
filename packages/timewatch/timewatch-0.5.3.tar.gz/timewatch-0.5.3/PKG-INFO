        ## timewatch
        
        Tired of reporting work hours every day/month?
        Your boss trusts you with your time, but HR demands you fill timewatch's form?
        You're too preoccupied with work, and forget filling up timewatch.co.il?
        
        We've all been there, just set up a monthly timewatch cron and get back to work!
        
        ### What is this?
        This script automatically sets default working hours for all work days using timewatch.co.il's web interface.
        It reads expected work hours for each day and automatically sets each day's work to that amount.
        It is therefor handling govt. off days and weekends, and is quite configurable.
        
        ## Usage
        To report required working hours for the current month, simply execute
        ```./main <company id> <employee number> <password>```
        
        ### Full usage and functionality
        
        ```
        usage: main.py [-h] [-y YEAR] [-m MONTH] [-v] [-o {all,incomplete,regular}]
                       [-s STARTTIME] [-j JITTER]
                       company user password

                                days, unsafe to vacation/sick days. incomplete = only
                                override days with partial records. regular - override
                                regular days (without absence reason) only
          -s STARTTIME, --starttime STARTTIME
                                punch-in time
          -j JITTER, --jitter JITTER
                                punching time random range in minutes.

        ### Installation

        git clone https://github.com/nirizr/timewatch.git
        cd timewatch
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```
        pip install timewatch --target './'

        ./main.py <args>
        ```
        
        ### Known issues
        * Doesn't sign the doc (I suggest you do it manually after reviewing there are no bugs in the report).
        * no support for reporting vacation/sick days through the script yet (You can report using timewatch's web interface before/after running the script)
