Description: tmpr : temp file sharing
        =========================
        
        A very simple file sharing utility that launches quickly and allows sharing
        files between many people with a set number of downloads (default 1, max 10).
        
        If there is an existing server then you can easily interact with it through
        the command line interface. In this case, set the global url option then
        upload and download::
        
            tmpr c --url=http://some.url.com/
            tmpr u /some/file
            tmpr d <code>
        
        For more information, look into tmpr --help. If there is no server you can
        easily start one yourself. In the basic form, simply run::
        
            tmpr s      # 's' is short for serve, see tmpr --help
        
        and point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888.  From there, you can follow
        the directions to upload and download files.  By default, it only runs on the
        local interface. It is recommended that if you wish the server to be available
        remotely to run it behind a webserver such as nginx or apache with forwarding
        set up between the two (so root privileges are not required).
        
        nginx setup notes, especially for larger max file sizes::
        
            server {
                listen 80;
        
                root /var/www/;
                index index.html index.htm;
                server_name <server-url>;
        
                location / {
                    client_body_buffer_size    1M;
                    client_max_body_size       128M;
        
                    proxy_pass http://localhost:3333;
                    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
                    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                }
            }
