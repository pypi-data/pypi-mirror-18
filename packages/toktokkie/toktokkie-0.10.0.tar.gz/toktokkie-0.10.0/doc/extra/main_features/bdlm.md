# Batch Download Manager

The Batch Download Manager (BDLM from now on) can be used to download files via the XDCC protocol normally used in conjunction with
IRC networks. The BDLM also support searching for files on three different packlist search engines:

* xdcc.horriblesubs.info
* NIBL.co.uk
* intel.haruhichan.com
* ixIrc.com

By being provided metadata by the user, the BDLM can also rename and iconize newly downloaded files and created 
directories using the same mechanisms described above.

It is possible to select more than one file to download (hence the 'batch')
