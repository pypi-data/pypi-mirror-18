====================
Configuration Loader
====================


:Status: Beta
:Documentation: http://trafaret-config.readthedocs.io/


This is a wrapper that loads yaml and checks config using trafaret_ while
keeping track of actual lines of file where error has happened. Additionally,
it can pretty print the error.

Basic Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   import trafaret
   from trafaret_config import read_and_validate

   TRAFARET = trafaret.Dict({'x': trafaret.String()})

   try:
       config = read_and_validate('config.yaml', TRAFARET)
   except ConfigError as e:
       e.output()
       sys.exit(1)


Example output (from a `test.py` which has better trafaret than example
above)::

    bad.yaml:2: smtp.port: value can't be converted to int
    bad.yaml:3: smtp.ssl_port: value can't be converted to int
    bad.yaml:4: port: value can't be converted to int
