Advanced Spectrum Generation
============================

Outside of generating a basic "observed" spectrum with the standard features 
that might present in a realistic asborption spectrum, the user can also 
customize the generated spectrum to have an arbitrary set of desired 
properties, e.g. wavelength range, spectral resolution, and included 
absorption lines. The following code goes through the process of setting 
such properties and displays the resulting spectra.

For this demostation, we'll be using a light ray that we've previously 
generated from a RAMSES dataset.  If you'd like to try to reproduce the 
spectra included below you can get the ray from the Trident project space using:

.. highlight:: none

::

   $ wget http://trident-project.org/data/sample_rays/ramses_ray.h5

Now, we'll load up a ray using yt::

   import yt
   import trident

   ray = yt.load("ramses_ray.h5")

We then generate a spectrum that goes from 1150 angstroms to 1250 angstroms 
with a resolution of 0.01 angstroms::

   sg = tri.SpectrumGenerator(lambda_min=1150, lambda_max=1250, dlambda=0.01)

From here, we can pass the ray to the SpectrumGenerator object to use in the 
construction of a spectrum.  As a first pass, we'll create a spectrum that 
just include the lines produced by hydrogen::

    sg.make_spectrum(ray, lines=["H"])
    sg.plot_spectrum('spec_H.png')

The resulting spectrum contains a nice, big Lyman-alpha feature.

If, instead, we want to shows the lines that would be in our spectral range 
due to carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, we can do the following::

    sg.make_spectrum(ray, lines=["C", "N", "O"])
    sg.plot_spectrum('spec_CNO.png')

And now we have:

.. image:: http://trident-project.org/data/doc_images/spectra/spec_CNO.png

We can see how these two spectra combined when we include all of the same 
lines::

    sg.make_spectrum(ray, lines=["H", "C", "N", "O"])
    sg.plot_spectrum('spec_HCNO.png')

which gives:

.. image:: http://trident-project.org/data/doc_images/spectra/spec_HCNO.png

We can get even more specific, by generating a spectrum that only contains 
lines due to a single ion species.  For example, we might just want the 
lines from four-times-ionized nitrogen, N V::

    sg.make_spectrum(ray, lines=["N V"])
    sg.plot_spectrum('spec_NV.png')

This spectrum only shows a couple of small lines on the right hand side.

.. image:: http://trident-project.org/data/doc_images/spectra/spec_NV.png

But if that level of specificity isn't enough, we can request individual lines::

    sg.make_spectrum(ray, lines=["C I 1193", "C I 1194"])
    sg.plot_spectrum('spec_CI_1193_1194.png')

And we end up with:

.. image:: http://trident-project.org/data/doc_images/spectra/spec_CI_1193_1194.png

To understand how to further customize your spectra, look at the documentation 
for the :class:`~trident.SpectrumGenerator` class and other 
:ref:`api-reference` documentation.
