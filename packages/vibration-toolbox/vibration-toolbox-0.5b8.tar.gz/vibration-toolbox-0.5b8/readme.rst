The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Python
=================================================

Joseph C. Slater and Raphael Timbo

This will eventually be the translated Engineering Vibration Toolbox,
originally written for Matlab, but with extra features only for
Python. This is an *educational* set of codes intended for
demonstration. You may find them useful for application, but that
isn't the intent.

Currently:

Type

.. code-block:: shell

   jupyter notebook

at your command prompt.

Take a look at ``vtb1_1.ipynb`` and ``vtoolbox Demos.ipynb``, but
recognize that they are not completely ready to go. Not even close.

However, it gives an idea of where I
want the project to go.

Sorry for being pithy... this project is a long way off. You're
welcome to help!
