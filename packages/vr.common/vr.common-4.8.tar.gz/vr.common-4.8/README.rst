License
=======

License is indicated in the project metadata (typically one or more
of the Trove classifiers). For more details, see `this explanation

Docs
====

There's `no good mechanism for publishing documentation
<https://github.com/pypa/python-packaging-user-guide/pull/266>`_
easily. If there's a documentation link above, it's probably
stale because PyPI-based documentation is deprecated. This
project may have documentation published at ReadTheDocs, but
probably not. Good luck finding it.
