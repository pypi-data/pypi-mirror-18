Description: Weakrefable
        ===========
        
        If you use the ``weakref`` module, you may be aware that some object do not
        support being weakly referenced to. For example, built-ins dict and list. 
        
        Trying to create a weak reference will ``raise`` a ``TypeError``.
        
        There does not seam to be any way from Python itself to check whether an object
        can be ``weakref``'d, though the CPython C-layer make that pretty easy. 
        
        This just exposes this functionality at the python level
