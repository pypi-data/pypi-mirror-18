Description: xnm
        ===
        
        xnm is a lightweight networkmanager menu for window managers missing
        one, such as xmonad.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Either retrieve from pypi using pip:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install xsms
        
        or clone this repo, and install using ``setup.py``:
        
        ::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/smcl/xsms
            $ cd xsms
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Using
        -----
        
        Once xnm is installed you can either launch it standalone in an xterm...
        
        ::
        
            $ python -m xnm
        
        ... or you can add it as an ``action`` in your xmobar setup, so that
        when you click an icon (I use ``DynNetwork``) like so:
        
        ::
        
             template = "... <action=`/home/sean/.xmonad/xnm.py`>%dynnetwork% <fn=1>ï‡¤</fn></action> ..."
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        NetworkManager can do a lot of things but I do not plan to do all of
        them, but my goals are (checkbox indicates whether completed or not):
        
        -  wifi
        -  [x] search
        -  [x] connect (open and authenticated using wpa-psk)
        -  [x] disconnect
        -  mobile broadband
        -  [ ] configure new
        -  [x] connect
        -  [x] disconnect
        -  bluetooth
        -  [ ] search
        -  [ ] pair
        
        Right now it can search for and connect to open and protected wifi
        networks, so there's quite a way to go :)
