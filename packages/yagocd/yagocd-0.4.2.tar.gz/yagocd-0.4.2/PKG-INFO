        Introduction
        ------------
        This library is a high level python API wrapper upon ThoughtWorks GoCD REST API.
        From the official documentation:
        
            Go Continuous Delivery is continuous integration/deployment server,
            which helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for worry-free.
        
        Using it, you can access to internals of the Pipelines, check their statuses, download Artifacts and more.
        It is designed with maximum comfort and productivity from the user perspective, so it should be very easy
        to use it in your own project.
        More information is available at official `documentation <http://yagocd.readthedocs.io>`_
        
        Installation
        ------------
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install yagocd
        
        Quick example
        -------------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from yagocd import Yagocd
        
            go = Yagocd(
                server='https://example.com',
                auth=('user', 'password'),
                options={
                    'verify': False  # skip verification for SSL certificates.
                }
            )
        
            for pipeline in go.pipelines:
                for instance in pipeline:
                    for stage in instance:
                        for job in stage:
                            # print artifact urls for each job
                            for artifact in job.artifacts:
                                for file_obj in artifact.files():
                                    print(file_obj.data.url)
        
                            # print property of each job
                            for key, value in job.properties.items():
                                print "{} => {}".format(key, value)

        Release History
        ---------------

        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        **Improvements**
        
        - Added support for pipeline config API.
        - Added support for version API.
        - Added support for plugin info API.
        - Added support for environments API.
        - Added methods for getting different internal information (undocumented): `support` and `process_list`.
        - Added magic methods for iterating and key based access for some classes.
        - All classes and their methods are now decorated with `@since` decorator, which adds possibility to check
          at run-time whether given functionality already supported in the GoCD server and let's dynamically select
          correct headers.
        
        **Testing**
        
        - Now tests are executed for GoCD version, running in Docker container, which add possibility
          to test for any available version of the server. Also cassettes are also saved individually for
          each GoCD version.
        - Added testing for PEP8 and other checks via `flake8`.
