Description: # Yosai AlchemyStore
        
        This is an *extension* project for [Yosai](http://www.github.com/yosaiproject/yosai) that features a complete ``AccountStore`` data store solution intended for quick-start projects using Yosai.
        
        An ``AccountStore`` is a data access object (DAO) that provides an interface to
        a datastore, in this case a relational database.  YosaiAlchemyStore is named as such
        to indicate its use of the [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org) library to enable all RDBMS connectivity.
        
        
        # Installation
        
        Install YosaiAlchemyStore from PyPI using pip:
            ``pip install yosai_alchemystore``
        
        
        ## Setup
        
        An AlchemyAccountStore can be configured through one of two ways:
        
        * Option 1: YAML Config File
            1. Define a system environment variable, YOSAI_ALCHEMYSTORE_SETTINGS, that points to 
               the location of alchemystore_settings.yaml file and ensure that the file
               permissions make it readable.
            
            2. Instantiate an AlchemyAccountStore without arguments.  
        
        * Option 2: Passing a dburl argument
            - instantiate an AlchemyAccountStore, passing a "dburl" argument as
              defined by SQLAlchemy:  http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#database-urls
        
        
        ## API
        
        The ``AccountStore`` API consists of two abstract base classes within the ``yosai.core.account.abcs`` module.
        It's a simple API, consisting of a request method to obtain Account credentials (passwords)
        and a request method to obtain Account authorization information (roles and permissions).
        
        
        ## Data Models
        
        Following is the database schema used to facilitate a simple, "flat" Role Based Access Control (RBAC) authorization policy.  This data model enables the most basic form of RBAC.

        ## Dev Status:  as of v0.0.5
        
        The project has been released after being tested as part of yosai integrated testing.
        Unit tests are pending development.
